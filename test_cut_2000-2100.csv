m30wi3,"Always so jealous of students at CSU not only for how highly ranked their program is but also for how beautiful Fort Collins is!! It’s just outside of Denver and at least compared to the small town my vet school is in, Fort Collins is a way better scene in terms of things to do outside of school. I couldn’t afford CSU with OOS tuition but would go there if I had the chance. I have a couple of friends that go to CSU and they have told me their fourth year has been a lot more manageable compared to my school. I’m a fourth year at TAMU btw. I’ve heard they did get their terminal surgeries taken away in junior surgery lab though so I’m not sure if that’s something that matters to you 😅"

Depressed_Dishwa5her,Thank you to all the responses ya'll have been really helpful. Id like to add that my main passion zoo veterinary and that is my end goal. I do hope to work full time at a zoo but my parents want me to have a private practice and be my own boss to earn more. Personally if i cant work with zoo and wildlife animals then Id rather not have my own clinic even if the salary is better.|I have always had a connection with wildlife and my main goal has always been in wildlife conservation. From my experience zoos are the best way to be directly involved in the health of wildlife. Although I have done a lot of research I am always willing to learn more. This is my passion and life long goal and the more informed I am the better.
LiveLoveLevelUp,"Talk to real people as well, but our field has its fair share of bullshit. I'm sure every field does, I hope it gets better.|Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, be kind, but show that you are willing to stand your ground. Its a complex issue, we work in a very competitive field, and obviously hierarchy is a big part of it no matter how much we want to pretend that we're all equal. 

You automatically place higher due to your degree and it bothers people who maybe feel they should be above you. They don't like loosing their place. So they will try to keep it with these tactics, it shows their lack of confidence and their immaturity. But its also a part of survival and nature. So you're being tested. I'd recommend working on your interpersonal skills, meditate, any type of personal development that allows you to feel grounded and confident in yourself. 

Stick to the people that treat you with respect, and make sure they know you appreciate them. Don't let the others get to you, set your boundaries if they cross them and take it easy, they're just insecure.   


You got this!|Talk to real people as well, but our field has its fair share of bullshit. I'm sure every field does, I hope it gets better."
roxysinsox,"I had a beautiful big, flat basket sitting around at home (but you could totally buy one!) and I went in and bought a bunch of the kinda stuff I chuck into my handbag when I know I may not get much time to eat. Granola bars, nut bars (though I knew that was safe because they had a giant jar of peanut butter out while I was there and you could smell it through the whole clinic) single serve seasonal fruit (ie: apples, oranges, pears, whatever is in season and will keep.) I bought a bunch of those little fruit gummy mini packs you put into kid lunches, single serve popcorn packs, single serve chips, single serve snacks that were gluten free (I think they were like yoghurt topped rice crackers in different flavours?) anyway, you get the gist, a bunch of single serve snacks, i used thick cardstock to make dividers (because AuDHD) I also found a metal tin of fun sized candy bars that fit perfectly at the end (I wanted something with a lid so wandering noses couldn’t get into it by accident) and added things like lollipops and I found a really fun box of cool stickers online that said “Pawfect!” And finished it off with a pen holder that had 25 really nice to write with (but not pricey because I bought them in bulk) pens and two dozen HB pencils with erasers on the end of them in it. I think all up it cost me something along the lines of $40? But I didn’t have to buy the basket and pen holder and the tin, as I already had them. 
It was kinda just a refuelling station for them. That was 7 years ago and they still have it (and they keep it very well stocked!!) ^.^ I see it any time they post photos of their staff area. It’s lovely. 🥰"

Various_Piccolo9925,"I’m genuinely curious:

Assuming someone has an average GPA and average vet hours (let’s say 3.5 GPA since that seems to be the average, and a normal amount of vet hours) what are the odds they get into vet school if they apply year after year to a variety of schools? I always hear about people giving up after about 2-3 cycles, but if they kept trying, would they statistically eventually get in?|Thanks so much. I worked 3 years as a manager at Chick-fil-A throughout high school, so I definitely have a lot of customer service experience and am excited to implement it at the clinic!|I should probably add that I have a lot of animal experience hours already with shadowing, working on farms, shelters, etc., so I understand how to handle animals (but am open to learning new handling methods at the clinic). I also wanted to add that this vet clinic’s entire staff i just going to be the vet, me, and the other assistant. It’s only a weekend only, small clinic, so I’m not just going to be shadowing, and the only experienced employee is the vet. She purposefully only took in pre-vet students for the job because she WANTS to teach, so I’m not at all worried about not being accepted with open arms or being “in the way.” She hired us to teach us. I’m going to be handling animals from the get go. Thanks for your advice, a lot of it was super useful!|Specialization is key!|Ditto this.

hubbard48,"I can attest that contract research organizations pay VERY well, as I currently work under a pathologist at one."
thatfluffybabyduck,"The best way to know for sure is to be in it. Take up a job as an assistant at a clinic in your area. You'll see EVERYTHING. 

You can have emotions and feelings in this field. It's just a normal part of being a person. However, you have to be able to compartmentalize and not let those personal feelings get in the way of what is best for your patients. You have to be able to reel it in every now and then and realize that not everything is about you.

It's okay to cry and get angry. It happens. Just make sure you're expressing those feelings in an appropriate setting. If you have to take 5 or 10 minutes to collect yourself, that's okay. Don't let people give you shit for it. It's better that you come back to work with a level head."
lilscrib,Amazing thank you so much! It honestly sounds great :)

nevertoomanytacos,"I wore a respiratory on my surgery/anesthesia rotations 4th year vet school while pregnant. As I was technically also employed by the school, I was able to get the OSHA person to fit test me with a respirator for free. I am small: 5ft, 100lb and so I fit into a 3M 142-6100 and likely could have fit into the medium at the end. Most people fit the medium. I think medium is the 6200. I used the 6006 cartridge because it protected against formaldehyde and I wore it on my necropsy rotation as well.

I bought these all on Amazon for pretty cheap"
Starrisa,"Yes. If your scavenging system is adequate, the only risky time is if you're masking patients down (hopefully not) and recovery (as they exhale shitloads of iso, especially bigger patients)

Jolly_Ad_1166,"I never seen so many comments about a preference for being referred to as “dr” before.

windslut,"Have both. It all depends if you want to do clinical medicine. My PhD is in pharmacology so many job offers with academia, research and drug companies.

I got both but ended up in wildlife and zoological medicine…..great career but not much money!!|Board certified in another specialty,  but considered surgery due to skill demonstrated in residency. 
Just want to say,  of all specialties,  surgery is a manual dexterity/innate skill specialty. Having worked with hundreds of vets,  some have innate skill and some will never be excellent surgeons. So this specialty is one where natural talent may play a role.  You are probably a little early in your career to make this determination, but there are many specialties you will be exposed to in vet school.|Find a store that sells the brand ABEO near you.

SprinkleOfWisdom,"Sure you can. I’ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week. So, you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo. Not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet. Also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo. Zoo vets are often huge generalists, so they often might phone in for advice from specialists - even human MD specialists. I saw that especially with primates. Possibilities are there, it just may limit some of your location options. The most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school, building good relationships, and trying different experiences in vet med. You may evolve your interests too which is great.|I'm a veterinarian in the US, so while I don't know the details of veterinary school systems internationally, I can say with confidence, that I would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager. Observe what they do. Ask them what they like and dislike about their job. What would they like for their career path? Ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age. Never put all your opinions into one person. Take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values. Have fun and stay curious about possibilities. :)"

MSmith3813,"You are correct.  Just more morons who think they are a veterinarian.|Because of the incorporation of vet medicine and the subsequent world view created by veterinary schools and the internet, being a veterinarian has changed dramatically and I am not sure it is worth it now.  

As it stands, you have little control over your fianancial success. Most young vets have not been through a recession.  Student debt is absurd and out of line with earning potential.  

If you can own your own practice, become creative in how your market, learn how to manage employees, and build a values based business, the sky is the limit both professionally and financially.  

If you can’t or choose not to pursue ownership, I would say it is definitely not worth being a long term associate.|You are correct.  Just more morons who think they are a veterinarian."

https://sipseywilder.com/collections/tech-hip-bag|I have zero interest in going the RVT route, so The only way I can make it work is by having an equal partner to share expenses with and also doing a fairly lucrative side hustle—in my case, I photograph dog sports & make around 20-30k/yr doing that on top of my meager vet assistant wage (which is higher than minimum wage, but still low). I really lucked out and my clinic is FANTASTIC and supportive and is very flexible with the time off I need.. last year I also made around $2000 in quarterly bonuses we receive if the clinic hits their profit goals.

Affectionate-Owl183,"I'm a tech at an emergency/specialty hospital...they aren't treating you right. Even if they were hesitant because you were a fairly new vet (which is somewhat understandable), there is no excuse for such harsh comments and judgement. I've been in my field for a long time, and unfortunately some techs can be petty. But the majority of the more experienced nurses I work with love being able to nurture fresh minds in the field. Maybe their feelings are more personality-based than medical based. Maybe the culture there is toxic. Maybe they ""don't have time"" for baby doctors and that other doc is the only exception. Anyway, I wouldn't let it destroy your confidence. You're fresh out, and you need a supportive environment that'll help you learn. And I'm sure there's a practice out there with nurses that would love to help you grow your skill set! When you meet them, don't discount their valuable experience (doctors aren't the only ones who can teach), and hopefully they'll treat you well and want to see you succeed. :) Don't let the bastards get you down!|Exotics Tech here!

Most reputable zoos have their own vet staff. I work at a large veterinary practice, and when zoos/aquariums DO need our facility it's usually for things like our CT or MRI machine. Or our dental equipment. They tend to show up with their own staff as well. Our exotics department (currently five doctors) doesn't really ever deal with them. If you work in a state with lenient laws then you may end up treating some ""zoo"" animals being kept as pets (not really the best thing ethically, IMO). Generally speaking, zoo and wildlife jobs pay very poorly. The best way to do both would be to join a practice as an exotics vet and probably see if you can foster relationships with local zoos, aquariums, and/or wildlife rehabs. We DO occasionally see animals such as raptors (falconry birds), exhibit animals from pet stores (have dealt with a gila monster, dart frog, and a tree monitor), and we've had a few one-off weird things (one lady has a rescue and brought in a confiscated wallaby). But if you're looking to work with larger zoo species such as giraffes, big cats, etc...you will very likely not get that opportunity in clinical practice, and likely not without becoming zoo boarded or at least having a lot of specialty internships/a residency. I know several zoo vets, and have been in the exotics field/community for over a decade.|Most of the time you need to 1) be really well connected and know a lot of people already in the zoo community and 2) wait very very patiently for someone to die or retire so that a position opens up (seriously...I'm not kidding...)|Have you thought about a less traditional route?

This is from AAHA's website:
'of this writing, there are 15 states in the US—including Florida, Colorado, and California—where nonveterinarians are allowed to own veterinary practices.""

I've known about this for a while because I read some articles about vet tech owned practices. Unfortunately my state doesn't allow techs to partner with vets in practice ownership, but food for thought. It would be a way for you to stay in the field, make a little more money (although low costs clinics obviously don't churn out a big profit), and not have the heavy debt associated with vet school. Food for thought!|Idk if you'd be up for it, but specialty hospitals are nearly always looking for per diems. You could stay on somewhere in a per diem capacity just to keep your skills sharp and your options open. An ER shift here and there definitely flexes your medical muscles. I know a few people who are semi-retired and still do this. I also know someone who does mobile ultrasound and does per diem work to stay on top of her skill set. And yet another who does two days per week at a slower-paced GP practice and a handful of ER shifts each month when she feels like it. Just an idea!|Not sure what types of species you'd like to study. I'd look up free vet tech CE. A lot of free CE online has anatomy-related topics. This website below focuses more on exotic animal anatomy, but as you can see they have a variety of free options.

https://lafeber.com/vet/?s=Anatomy

Additionally, a veterinary anatomy atlas would probably be helpful as others have suggested (and you could refer back to it as much as needed). Even my undergrad ""Animal Anatomy and Physiology"" book has some very detailed pics of the musculoskeletal system in various species. 

Good Luck!|My time NOT spent in front of clients is my favorite part of work. I get to joke around with my coworkers (sometimes dark or inappropriate, but still funny). We sometimes talk about our personal lives (while doing x-rays, drawing blood, holding for ultrasound, etc.). We fall. We laugh. We get pissed on together. We jokingly punch each other. We can be blunt when we need to be. I just don't feel like any of those magical bonding moments would happen with clients always two feet away. The fact that I like and can mess with my coworkers makes the job so much more tolerable.|Lafebervet is wonderful for free CE regarding exotics (both at the tech and doctor level). Also don't be afraid to ask to shadow an exotics doc for a week or so. It may not seem like long, but it'll be very enlightening. Most GPs or ER doctors who approach them as if they're a cat or a dog do them a disservice. There are so many that visit us having come from doctors who never gave them solid husbandry advice, misdiagnosed them, missed something that the species is known for having (such as dental disease in rabbits) or just inappropriate meds/therapies altogether. I understand they're ""trying"" but honestly you really have to familiarize yourself with these species just as much as you would a cat or dog if you intend to see them. There's no way to just ""casually"" treat a few exotics a year without compromising the level of care.

Examples:

1) Spoke with a lady today. Her rabbit is MORBIDLY obese. Like I'd be concerned to put it under anesthesia. She saw her other vet for 7 years. They never mentioned this, and never asked what she fed or told her that she should not be free feeding pellets OR that she should have stopped having an alfalfa-based pellet at 6 months when he matured. Also didn't tell her to spay them (they have a notoriously high incidence of metastatic repro cancer after about 4 years of age).

2) I saw a rabbit that had multiple holes in its face through our ER. Their vet was trying to ""drain"" the abscesses on its face (this is not appropriate in rabbits, their pus is solid). Did not attempt to address underlying dental issues that were causing the abscesses.

3) 10yr old African grey that had wellness exams one and off over the years with their GP. The bird ""seized"" nearly every visit. They were told it was stress. Parrots are extremely known for atherosclerosis but this was never mentioned. By the time it had ""the big one"" (the stroke that finally brought it in through ER as opposed to the more minor ones it was having while hypertensive during handling events)...it's vasculature on radiographs looked AWFUL. It died in hospital. It's possible that sooner therapy and recognition would have helped.

4) Every decrepit reptile that's ever been seen by someone who doesn't know reptiles well and arrives drier than a raisin in the Sahara because not one vet told them that reptiles take up most of their hydration through their vent and actually need to be physically soaked in water. Seriously the amount of things that come in for kidney failure because they've spent their whole life dry. So sad.

5) 2 year old snake that had an under tank heater. Was seen elsewhere. Owners were told that the funny looking patch on its belly was just a ""rough shed"" by an RDVM. It came in approximately two days later for ""not eating"". This was because it wasn't a rough shed. It had third degree burns along the ventrum because O's hadn't placed the under tank heat far enough from the glass, and the snake was a burrowing species.

I encourage you to try and help the exotics nuggets as much as possible, but learn from some solid people and really put in the time to do your CE so you can provide the best care possible!|Idk where you live but in the greater New York Metro area 100k (assuming you are a single person or want to live alone) won't actually get you that far. Especially when you factor in the massive crippling debt of payments most post-grads are stuck with. I only did undergrad and if I hadn't consolidated my payments I would've owed 800/month. Also rent near where I live is running like 2k even for the crap places right now. 100k truthfully isn't ""a lot of money"" anymore. I actually know several vets to have side jobs or work more than one clinic. Or pick up per diem shifts for extra pay. Welcome to inflation.|Honestly it depends on how important experiencing another culture is to you. You may not get the chance to live in another country again, and that can be a valuable experience. Personally for me living abroad isn't something I really prioritized. And as someone who racked up a LOT of debt for just my undergrad degree (and is going to be paying it off until I die)...I'd legit go with whatever school is cheaper. Debt really negatively impacts your life, especially your life as a young adult who's just graduated. Having heftier school loan payments may severely limit the types of jobs you're able to take (it did for me). I ended up having to turn down several dream jobs because they just didn't pay well enough for me to break even with my loans. I'm pretty happy now, but my debt level caused me to do a great deal of settling when it came to my career options. If you had any inkling to want to try general practice, shelter care, nonprofit work, zoo vet, wildlife center, etc... those don't necessarily make the big bucks. When I was young I went to the higher priced dream school, and really wish I hadn't. Of course, this is you we're talking about, not me. Just offering one perspective.|Don't stay there too long. You're still just out of school (2 years is NOT long). You need a place that'll challenge you to grow in your medical knowledge, and will allow you to find *your* way of practicing medicine that is up to your standards. Maybe consider taking a year or two to do ER in a specialty practice. That's the type of environment I work in as a Tech. It can be tough, but it makes for some REALLY clinically well-rounded doctors and nurses.

I'd never go back to GP. And honestly I've seen a lot of cases that have been mismanaged (to the point of malpractice) by people working in clinics that practice what we call ""old medicine"". These types of places don't tend to be big on fully utilizing all of the diagnostics, don't have high standards of care for things like sedation/anesthesia (YES an OHE should be intubated, always), tend to have doctors that ONLY feel comfortable recommending drugs that have been used for decades, and often have lost their passion when it comes to themselves and their staff keeping up on current CE/innovations in the field. Sounds like you may be in one such place. I'm in an environment where most of the techs know how to interpret bloodwork, manage DKAs, do complex wound care, run a code, spot and identify arrhythmias, etc. Even for our exotics, we intubate almost everything and do preventive bloodwork. Imagine what you could learn, and what you could be allowed to do if you worked with a team that all strived for a higher standard of care. Best of luck!"

Once you get into school, it becomes completely up to you what you want to practice. What it comes down to is your level of competency so if you want to work at a practice and see exotic pets you just have to work with the place that hires you. Zoo medicine is something that a lot of veterinarians do on the side and as you become more comfortable dealing with the animals the more opportunities that arise. There are not really any specific certifications you need but it’s very competitive so doing residencies and internships will be very useful!

So, is it a non-profit?!  Because, if it is, I am not sure you can have an 'owner'.

The big red flag for me (keep in mind, I am a jaded mofo who has been screwed over by owners/corp. in the past) is you don't pay competitive wages (you basically said it yourself), build up a great practice under the guise of non-profit, then the owner sells out for millions.  

So, it sounds like this is a 'for profit' company; they just invest some money back into the community/staff.

I don't know the pathophysiology of it (it's not just because they are 'dewclaws', as I would expect the actual dewclaw to look the same in this case).  

With that said, it may be possible to clip them for the first couple of months, but after the neuter, it really would be an extra surgery.|>another vet chiming in from purely based on a cat owner’s perspective with no context is very dumb lol (assuming no context)

As it turns out, this 'vet' is not a vet, but a tech or assistant who misrepresented themselves.  I am staying out of it (letting my office manager handle it).

Keep in mind, that February is traditionally our slowest month (that is why its 'dental month' - to try and drum up appointments).

I couldn't agree more.  

A love of medicine, science, curiosity, and problem-solving is far more important than a love for animals.  Keep in mind, many vets (historically, most), went into the field to work with livestock/equine.  You need to enjoy working WITH animals for most veterinary fields, but a love for animals... it may be a hindrance.|Yeah, I am not willing to quit over this just yet.  

I was sending the notes to the techs that didn't write the histories, but that is a lot of work for me (checking what tech did the history, not always obvious, sending the message, then checking if it was ever finished (usually several days later)).

As of today, I am sending a list of incomplete notes to the office manager, letting her hunt down the responsible tech.  I am not finalizing the notes until the history is put in... I hope the extra work on her will light a fire under someone's ass to make this a priority.  

There is no way i can take my own history and TPR's without seeing a LOT less clients... but I guess that is an option... if I see less, the owner may make it more of a priority.|>Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork?

Thats next!  As I mentioned, I am sending a list of the notes that do not have histories done (from the previous day) every day to the OM for her to deal with.  

If it doesn't get corrected (and, to be fair, I am not talking about the occasional missed history, I am talking about +50% in a day!), I will be blocking off the last 2 hours of the day for ""Tech Appointment Catchup"", and then just going home.

While I am not going to quit over this, if the owner starts seeing blocked-off appointments at the end of the day, they may start taking a more active role in enforcing the rules.|>and you don't have the information you need to deal appropriately with the patient and client?

To be clear, i am getting full/complete histories (everything I need to do my job), but they are not being put into the records.  By the time I get to it (writing my notes), I may not remember all the details - and I get stuck with incomplete notes/histories.  


>You might be seeing more clients, but you're leaving that much more work unfinished. I don't think that's a wise trade off. 

I agree!  I just feel like I should be the bottleneck (in regards to how many patients I can treat in a day), not support staff.  

Let me clarify, 'up to a point'.  I understand sometimes support staff gets overwhelmed, but we are talking about 12-15 wellness appointments a day here... not a busy ER.|>So the offer is basically 140k base plus 20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription.

I do not understand this... are you saying they are offering you 140k base **PLUS** 20% on services?  I mean, if so, I would be all over that in a heart beat!

Or is it a prosal model, where you are getting 20% production on services... with a 140k base (because that sucks!)|>No! It’s 140k guaranteed but I don’t know how much do I have to pull in before the production kick in. The 20% is only on top of what you makes more. 

Yeah, thats what I thought.  I think that sucks TBH.

Basically, you have to produce 700K for the hospital (175K per quarter) in services before you see a production check.    


>This is pretty standard pro Sal stuff.

It is, but you said 140k **+** 20% (thats not standard prosal).  But I now understand what you mean.

I think ""20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription"" Sucks!  I get 22% on EVERYTHING except 15% on food and flea/tick products.

I mean, Cytopoint injections, Proheart injections, Apoquel, some Antibiotics, are a large % of your gross.  Unless you are doing a ton of surgeries, you are going to have a really hard time making production IMO.

Also, do labs count as 'services'!?  I assume so, but don't be sure.

I think 22% is probably the norm, the highest I ever got was 25%.

Another big question (and it's HUGE), but do your PTO days get pro-rated with respect to your production?!  If not, its not PTO (and you are losing money when you take your time off)|When I first got out I would jump at the chance to come in and shadow with an experienced vet and do any procedure that I wasn't 100% comfortable with.  I learned 90% of all the surgeries I currently do in the first 2 years after I graduated!

Now is your chance to grow as a new vet (it gets harder to learn (or want to learn) new things as time goes on).  Yeah, it's your day off, but it will pay dividends down the line.    
Perhaps (if you are willing), explain that you want to come in on your days off, but those particular days just were not possible.  Give him a few other options over the next week or two (or month) where you can come in and shadow/learn more advanced procedures. 

You cannot rightfully expect him to use HIS time to help you when you are in trouble on YOUR time.  Sure, we all get in over our heads, and some help is always going to be needed (even for older vets), but you shouldn't expect someone to come running to help you when you (and you will) drop a pedicle if you are not willing to put in the extra time now.|>If the only surgical mentorship/training offered is unpaid extra days of work that is not appropriate. 

If I am teaching a new grad to do routine surgeries, then I am not working (basically the same as coming in on my day off).  It's one thing to jump into surgery to help with something, it's another to be training them.  It sounds like OP needs a bit more help than the occasional question.  

NOTE: I am not suggesting that I wouldn't help a new grad do a complicated/non-routine surgery, but just as I am willing to take my time to help them, so should the new grad use their *personal* time to learn.|Not really.  Unless a level of mentoring and hand-holding was baked into the contract (or employment agreement), your boss would expect you to do all reasonable procedures from the day you were hired (and OHE's and IVC placement are certainly reasonable skills for a licensed veterinarian).  

I personally wouldn't hire a vet that only had one spay under their belt (unless there was an agreement that the vet wouldn't be doing surgeries).|>he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks.

I am not exactly sure what that means... graduate salary?  Is that like an internship/training i.e. took a pay cut for increased mentorship?  If so, then my previous statements should be disregarded and yes, they should be teaching you while you are working (not your off days).|I've only done one in 15 years (meth head, was convinced he'd drown the dog).

Incidentally, and this is completely anecdotal.  Three of the doctors (new grads) never used it when they started, I assume because they just graduated and were taught not to.

>Scrolling Reddit and ended up in vet subreddit.

Been there done that!

>Both vets I see clinic policy is bw in last 30 days and Two emergency vet clinics do it too.

Different vets will have different opinions on the matter.

My 2 cents:

\- Sometimes bloodwork is necessary, regardless of the surgery (sick patient, history of organ dysfunction, etc.)

\- Sometimes it is good based on the breed (Dobermans can have a bleeding disorder, Yorkies and other small breeds are predisposed to liver shunts)

\- Sometimes it's necessary based on the surgery you are doing (liver biopsies, splenectomies, ect)

\- Sometimes age plays a role; older patients have an increased risk of a relevant problem

But... in young healthy dogs, for routine (and some non-routine) procedures, I feel like its unnecessary.  Sure, its 'good' information to have before going in, but if you have suture up a laceration or remove a ruptured eye, are you going to not perform the surgery because an owner refuses bloodwork?  Some people will, but I feel you should just document the clients refusal and do the best you can.

Interestingly enough, there is a big move in human medicine to NOT do full blood panels on young healthy individuals prior to most surgeries.  Oftentimes times they find things that are completely irrelevant and complicate matters unnecessarily (they call them 'incidentalomas'.

In human medicine, they may get a glucose, BUN, and PCV (to check for anemia), but that's it!

In 15 years I don't think I EVER found an abnormality in an otherwise healthy individual that changed my anesthetic protocol/halter surgery.  Now, I have found things that need to be worked up further and that may lead a legitimate problem, but they rarely affect immediate surgery.

People def. will disagree with me on this, and I will be happy to discuss further if there is interest, but full bloodwork on otherwise healthy individuals (I feel) can be optional.

NOTE: I also work with a population where bloodwork might increase the cost of the surgery by 33-40%, placing the needed surgery out of a client's budget.|As others have said, I will add a common real-life scenario...

I use a three-clamp technique (two proximal to the ovary, one at the proper ligament), I also cut just distal to the second hemostat before placing my ligature.  That scares some newer vets, but I find once you get the ovary out of the way, it easier to make a secure knot.

That said, it sounds like you have an issue with your ligatures.  In my experience, that's due to inadequate exposure of the tissue.

Some new grads have been taught not to break down the suspensory ligament (and somehow suture everything intra-abdominal...)?  I have no idea how they do that.  Are you breaking down the suspensory to get better exposure?

Morgimeister,"This is fantastic, absolutely try to get this published.

Saw that one of your references is from Dr. Chigerwe at Davis, which I find ironic (not that you used him, but surprised he published something on this topic) as I saw him do absolutely nothing to prevent the abuse of veterinary students and his residents when I was there 2016-2019. Maybe things have changed, but when I worked for C Barn I saw his residents working 100 hour weeks regularly, sleeping at the barn when they could, skipping meals, and being reduced to tears on a regular basis. When I rotated through C Barn as a 4th year with him I was there 80-100h/week. He also mandated that vet students work outdoors without providing appropriate respiratory PPE during the California Camp fires when the air quality in Davis was the worst in the WORLD. Let’s just say I’m very much not a fan.|I think things have changed, going home at 6pm was absolutely unheard of when I was at Davis and especially on C barn. Per the 4th year below, it does seem things have improved.|I’m happy you had a different experience. Again, I graduated in 2019, so before you matriculated, and I know that some things have changed since then. I’ve been told 4th year students are no longer required to provide 6am/6pm treatments? So that does help to shorten a day significantly. I never heard of a 6pm cutoff time, especially since that’s when evening treatments were due.

I was also livestock track and worked in C barn for 2.5 years as a Barn Nurse. I spent 5 weeks in C barn (as one of my rotations fell during a holiday) and can only speak to my experiences seeing how students and residents were treated during my time, so I did so. I do feel that Dr. Chigerwe is a fantastic clinician and lecturer, and I felt that in lecture, he was very sensitive and responsive to student questions and mental health issues. This was not the case in clinic. I’m sorry to say it seemed like a trend - I saw more than one incidence where an exhausted student or resident was openly sobbing and he reacted in an absolutely frigid way. On one day while on rotation with Chigerwe, I was told to show back up at 6am after working a 14h day and then being called in overnight, so had at best an hour of sleep. I’m sorry to speak negatively of a colleague but my experiences with him left such an impression as to make me overprotective of my own veterinary student externs (I now work in high volume spay/neuter because I enjoyed the extensive surgery experience we had on livestock track). 

I agree that the major issue is systemic, but when individuals feed into the system it helps to perpetuate it. I think that calling colleagues out on behavior that goes against the tenants set out by the AVMA is not only acceptable, but necessary to protect ourselves. If you saw a veterinary colleague abusing animals, would you not fail to act or say something? It’s time we did the same for each other. It is the faculty’s job to advocate for those who are trying to learn from them and I’m happy that he is now appearing to do so.|It honestly doesn’t sound then like things have changed enough, even as you defend him.

Even if you slept every single one of those 6h instead of taking care of whatever other human needs you’ve been neglecting, we know anything less than 7h has an impact on your mental and physical health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/ . We are doctors who should be basing decisions from peer-reviewed research, so I’m curious how Dr. Chigerwe arrived at the idea that 6h off is acceptable. Perhaps the mental toll of chronic sleep deprivation is why I’m aware of several egregious medical and surgical errors on the part of the residents in C Barn. And I can’t hardly fault them because with that degree of chronic sleep deprivation, they were essentially trying to be doctors under the same effects as heavy intoxication. And why hasn’t the livestock service hired more student workers or technicians to perform technician duties as they do on other services? Instead of forcing these tasks on paying 4th year students? Again, it’s not enough, and Dr. Chigerwe has more power than you think to do more. Again, please believe the possibility that I had a different experience than you. Sure, we all know there are faculty who are even worse in their treatment of students and residents, but they are typically well known within a teaching hospital. It is not ironic to call out abuse when it’s seen, particularly if that person is clever at hiding abuse behind outward projections of caring about student and resident health and wellbeing.|Thank you for the context. I’m sure things have improved, maybe more than marginally. Were the errors I saw rare? I don’t know. I’m going to exclude the years I worked as a barn nurse. In my first C barn rotation as a fourth year, a resident microwaved colostrum at high temp, instead of gently warming it in a hot water bath. The calf it was intended for developed failure of passive transfer, and that calf had to be euthanized due to unresolving infections. This resident unfortunately had so many animals die under his care that he had a nickname that included the word “doomsday”. That same rotation, a dairy cow received an extended inappropriate banamine dosage and frequency, and we had to call poison control as part of a CYA to get a treatment plan together to treat the iatrogenic exposure. One of my classmates who was on a following rotation was sliced open by a different resident while they were performing a fetotomy and he had to go to urgent care. A few days later, this same resident accidentally removed a section of a sheep’s colon after failing to identify it as belonging to the GIT and the animal ultimately had to be euthanized. 

Does this frequency seem like extremely rare occurrences to you? If so, I’d be very concerned about animals under your care when you graduate.

Not an error, but looking back on my texts with classmates from that time, another classmate missed several learning opportunities including a goat mastectomy because she was told by Chigerwe that she had to muck out her own patients’ stalls because there wasn’t enough staff to do it. Is that an education?

I know it can be hard to have your mentors criticized, so I understand the defensive attitude. I’ve been disillusioned many times over the years and it can be a painful process. Fortunately, Reddit is a forum that is intended for individuals to share first hand accounts using a (thin) veil of anonymity. I have never spoken in an actual public forum about the very real experiences I had with Dr. Chigerwe and C Barn, which is honestly regrettable. It is very silly to be admonished on veterinary professional behavior by a student who is 5 years my junior and who still hasn’t worked a day in their life as a DVM. It is also silly to attempt to censor someone on Reddit. I suppose I admire the confidence? It’s confidence I wish I had to speak out sooner against the culture of toxicity and abuse I experienced and witnessed those years. Regardless, cheers to you on the confidence, as it means Davis hasn’t crushed your spirit. And good luck getting to the finish line!|Female, small animal. Deep South.

catanddogtor,"GPA is certainly important for some specialties, but the other method to land an internship/residency is networking. But it depends on the specialty of course.

I've always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a B average. In my fourth year, I did rotations at locations where I wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics. During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match. (Making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared, knowing about the diseases and medications, jumping in to help as much as possible etc). And now I'm a boarded specialist. Meanwhile, one of my intern-mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was.. well, very awkward.|Also, I went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors, tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations (when they occurred before the match) and then asked them for LORs.|I'm not too sure about what grades people are looking for. My resident mate and I both just networked our way into residency outside the match. For dermatology, a good number of the residency positions are outside the match, so you have a couple different avenues for residency. Higher grades are generally helpful for the match, networking is very helpful in or outside the match. Doing a derm internship can make a big difference, because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way. NAVDF is a good place to network too."
With_Her_Spoon,"Is there anything consumers can do to help/apply pressure?

I wish these experiences were more well known to the general public and pet owners. I’m stumbled across this after seeing some strange dynamics at my dog’s last visit at one of the Mars owned chains and I wanted to research a bit. 

I was interested in finding a new veterinary practice that’s kind to their staff because (selfishly) that staff is who is taking care of my baby. And after reading through this, as a consumer I have a responsibility to spend money responsibly and avoid companies with unhealthy labor practices.

Lopsided-Switch-8404,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. 

Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.

This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.

Senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation.

There's an in-house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation, and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly.

There needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules."

Over the years I’ve been able to grow into a more “management” type position. Unfortunately with that I do less vet assistant work, and more inventory, ordering, and admin work. But I am now making $25/hr in my position. If you’re able to work your way up and take on responsibilities within your clinic, you can potentially increase your pay. But that will probably come with less vet assisting duties if you’re taking on different responsibilities. Or just more work on top of everything you already do, so you should be prepared to have less down time or work more hours.

throwawaybutter2023,"This depends on your goals (which you do not have to decide upon right away—focus on getting into vet school first!)

For starters, most zoos have exotics as part of their program (plenty of zoos have ferrets, rabbits, birds, etc which fall under the ‘exotics’ umbrella because they’re also common in the pet trade).  So if you’re a full time zoo vet, you will be seeing exotics.  But becoming a zoo vet is extremely competitive and difficult, and will require a lot of personal sacrifice.

There are also vets in private practice who see exotics.  Some even build up a client base so that they can almost exclusively see exotics.  Some of these vets will volunteer time and resources with small scale zoos who don’t have a full time vet, and that way they can get a small amount of zoo exposure.  Ultimately, zoo and exotics has a lot of crossover.|Thank you for this!!! I did two internships because I was on the speciality path and burnt out.  I was essentially forced to not do a residency because I knew that I wouldn’t survive it with how abysmal my mental health was from my internships.  It is pure BS that universities who make millions a year cannot pay house officers more, and the way house officers are treated is proof that the way these universities preach about “work life balance” and student wellbeing is pure lip service.|Going off of your first point, from the university side I also saw so many specialists leave (either to leave the profession entirely or for private practice).  I experienced the shutdown or near shutdown of multiple speciality services (including dermatology and neurology).  Not only was this concerning from a lack of teaching resources and patient care, it was frankly insulting and traumatic to residents.  I knew multiple residents who, after working their asses off to get to that residency, were forced to watch their programs dissolve and have to move to a different state to be patched in to some other universities residency.  This was also devastating to interns who were interested in that speciality and suddenly no longer had that service or letter of reference available.  I think this profession is actively destroying its specialists and I fully agree—we won’t have enough specialists in the near future.|Another intern quit during my second internship and the overall tone about their quitting was very negative and that they were basically “too weak to cut it.”  I agree, these systems shut you down from being able to speak out.|I’ll also add that even becoming a specialist isn’t a guarantee of significant wage increase, especially if you’re on the university side.  Many specialists in academia are making less than what most GPs are making.  This is driving a lot of specialists out of education (and for many, out of the field entirely).  I’ve also talked to financial planners who say that you don’t truly financially recover from the 4-5+ years of lost potential revenue while doing internship and residency, even if you become a specialist with higher wages compared to GPs.  You simply cannot make up for that many years of abysmal pay when you could’ve been making six figures with your DVM.|Just a small thing I found that’s helped some new(er) graduates I’ve worked with—are you at a clinic full time?  If so, do they have the means to subsidize the cost of radiology reviews for you?  I’ve worked at clinics that cover the cost of radiology reviews (often within the x ray cost) or at least partly offset it so you can get a radiologist opinion on most or all of the images you take.  I feel like that’s super helpful because you can still try interpretation on your own, get a radiologist’s final say, and often those services can offer consultation calls for more detailed discussion.|Got very close to leaving three years out.  Did two internships followed by a year in GP.  Was horrifically burnt out and miserable, and on the verge of leaving vet med entirely, so I left to do relief with tentative plans to move to mobile euthanasia, lab animal, or anything else that offers decent pay without being a GP full time.  Had a few classmates who did similarly.  Unfortunately in my experience, leaving entirely is quite hard because it’s rare to match the salary you can attain with your doctorate.|So far, very enjoyable!  I like making my own schedule and the pay is quite good.  However, you sacrifice benefits being covered for you such as health insurance (I was able to enroll in my partners), PLIT, disability, etc, so those can incur pretty high out-of-pocket costs.  You will also have to pay higher quarterly income taxes as an independent contractor.  And of course, no PTO—you’ll have to work extra to save accordingly if you want time off.  

I personally don’t like having to plan these things for myself or the idea of hiring someone to do it, so I am only doing relief until something full time plays out.  I know lots of folk who have been in relief for a long time and LOVE it, but it’s not free of downsides.  

And I’m wondering how you found a job in government!  I’ve been looking but haven’t found any leads—maybe I’m looking in the wrong places?|Seconding the animal control point -- don't forget, as a vet you're a mandatory reporter in most states.  If you feel that the animal is suffering and is being deprived of appropriate medical care, it is within your rights to contact animal control.  I feel that this isn't necessary or applicable in the majority of cases, but it is always within your reach.|I’m gonna lay it out honestly to you, OP, as I just left a hospital with extremely similar circumstances.  A hospital that is as far gone as yours will take a lot more than a new MD to turn around—my prior hospital took on an excellent new MD and despite all of her efforts, nothing changed.  This hospital has a deeply ingrained culture issue, and it’s not worth the sacrifice to your mental or physical health (or the risk to your license) to try to stick it through this circus.  Best choice I ever made was leaving and I would think about doing just that.|I second this!!! Also Stoskopf’s fish medicine and if you are into invertebrates, Lewbart’s Invertebrate Medicine|Agree with many of the comments below.  I was on the path to be a wildlife/zoo veterinarian, and ended up leaving that path because of the INCREDIBLE intensity of post graduate training and low pay involved.  Wildlife is one of the most competitive fields of vet med and you will not be paid well.  Also -- there are some things in wildlife that you might not find ethically doable.  Sometimes you need to cull wildlife for population control or infectious disease management.  Sometimes you will need care for wildlife that is being kept captive for research projects (which may include things like artificial insemination, inoculating those animals with disease, etc).  

Even in small animal medicine, there are ugly realities of cruelty and neglect that you will encounter on a regular basis -- and a legal system that isn't always the most caring or attentive regarding animal cruelty.  You will HAVE to learn about large animal and production medicine in veterinary school.  In my opinion, liking animals is not a good reason to become a vet.  No matter what field you're in, the majority of your job with be interacting with people and not animals.  And those people can often be difficult, noncompliant, unappreciative, and sometimes downright nasty."

I think a lot of techs have the attitude of “I know better than doctors” and like to try and push their experiences on new grads if you let them. I think it’s fair to ask for a meeting and state what your boundaries are, like if you want them to hold off on all comments entirely, if you only want help if you’re stuck, if you only want help if you’re missing something. Also lay down that they should never be correcting you I front of clients, if they have something to say/ask, wait until you’re both out of the room. Bottom line is they should be trying to support you, and everyone in the clinic needs to be patient while you learn.|I had a human doctor take out sutures on her dog after a large lumpectomy after 3 days because she thought it looked fine. Obviously everything dehisced and she tried to get us to cover it cause it must have been something we did wrong. Not that she admitted to taking out the sutures 11 days early|I left GP after almost 10 years in the industry (6 as a Registered Vet Tech) to work at my local city shelter (BC Canada) I make over $30 an hour now. Im unionized, I have so much vacation I hardly know what to do with it. I’m in charge of the shelter medical decisions, and I have basically no budget (within reason). Lots of my friends left the regular GP emerg life to go be reps with veterinary companies (food, cremation, and drugs). I think unless you get very lucky you can’t necessarily make a real career and retire as a GP or even emerg technician. I think that if you’re passionate you do it for as long as you can, and then switch your area of work before you get burnt out. I couldn’t be happier in my shelter job, but who knows how long I will feel fulfilled here. Regardless there are lots of opportunities to make real living wages as a tech, I just found that hardly exists in practices, at least not without some other trade off like terrible hours or other crap.|Aww that’s so sad OP.

jonbobiscool,Expect and advocate for 120-140 as a new grad in that area. Let me know if you’re interested in the Portland area at all for an externship!
gatorbetic,It's low in comparison to the debt you take on - can be upwards of 400+ k to go to vet school. Similar to med school however MDs make 2-3 x what we do leaving school.
whoopsie_dasiy,"Female, in NY, NY. Small animal GP for $105,000 for 24 hour week 😊. 12 days PTO. Supplement with relief shifts which are $1000-$1500 for weekday and $1200-$1900 weekend in the city.|AFTER taxes?!? 🤯 YGG"
sleflvt,"Do you want people to call you your name or dr your name?

If okay with just your name, I'd go with name DVM
If want to be called doctor, go dr name.

Also, decide if want to go by first or last name; I would not put both names on your scrubs

I'm an LVT so quite a bit different for me but I only have my first name than LVT
But I'm back in school and if/when I get DVM I planned on going with Dr First Name"
purplepoodless,"would you mind clarifying, you made 22% of 240k, or your production was over a million?|thats awesome!!"
thinkpup,This is animal abuse. Could this be illegal?
VooDooJezebel,"Oh honey in Western Washington 400,000 is the average cost of a crappy old condo."
ProfessionTimely2565,How many shifts per week / month?
medical_scribe_betch,"I appreciate the insight. It is definitely a lot and you’re right, I can always travel when I have more disposable income in the future|Thank you for your insight.|Thank you for the insight and advice. It would be 120k different in tuition + cost of living. Tuition is about an 80k difference.|I appreciate the insight|I have definitely been exposed mostly to small animal and marine wildlife medicine. I’d like to stay in those areas as I find the most satisfaction from conservation work and community care work through small animal practice|Thank you for the perspective ! I really appreciate it|I think the vet field gets a bad reputation due to the statistics. Obviously most are overworked and underpaid, but the majority of vets I’ve spoken to in a variety of settings say that the vet field, while challenging, is what keeps them coming back to work everyday. Sure other jobs are easier and you can make more money, but this is a passion for a reason. With everything, moderation is needed. If you fear your mental health deteriorating due to full time work as a vet, prioritize setting boundaries early. Like in the interview process.  make sure you are setting yourself up for success in all the ways you need. You are the one providing the healthcare and should in turn make an effort to keep yourself healthy. Don’t be afraid to say no to someone or something if it will truly affect your mental health. The vet field is a truly unique one and something that gives you what you put into it."
KerriM89,"I worked in a very similar situation, I was at the clinic for almost 3 years and I just wasn’t myself and was miserable. I ended up taking a leave of absence and in that time found another job at a smaller clinic with amazing staff and I’m so much happier and my former colleagues who I still talk to even notice the difference in me. A place that is soul sucking and bad for your mental health is never a good place to stay, you need to think about yourself and not worry about letting down your coworkers your health is more important!"
hawthornehopper,"I did two internships and a residency. I needed years after my training was over to start to feel “normal” again. My physical and mental health were both markedly affected. I have so much more I’d like to say but I’ll finish with - this needs to be published. Please submit it! Maybe JAVMA or even Vet Record just to get it out there!|I would strongly recommend choosing a specialty practice like bluepearl (or I know Medvet has a similar program) so you can get closer experience with not just ER but the specialty services as well. I do not think you need an internship to get proper mentorship and I do agree that, if you have no plans to specialize, these programs seem to make a lot more sense!"
WatercressFabulous11,"Out of curiosity, what is the lowest grade you can have for applying for residency? I’m normally an A student with a few B’s here and there but am really struggling in one class and worried I could get a C or C-. I’m interested in pursuing dermatology "
SillyGarlic3065,"1) Food. Preparing healthy food. Planning what you're going to eat to avoid unhealthy snacks. 

2) Short workouts. Walking, some exercises, or stretching. 

3) Enough water and enough sleep."
iamcnicole,Wow this thread is depressing me.|That last part though! 💯|Its definitely a thing and it can be lucrative as there are few vets that do it and hiring a GP is way cheaper than calling a boarded surgeon. Many vets are shying away from surgery for some reason. Im in Houston TX. I used to relief for a few practices doing surgery-only. Also have a HQHV Spay/Neuter background.|Get some good rest and hope for the best!
