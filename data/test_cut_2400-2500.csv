bmillevoi66,"I would definitely look through the list yourself and make simple PowerPoint pages going over the key topics of each disease. That's what I did, especially for chickens and pigs, and it helped me immensely.|I used the ICVA list that provides the disease topics you can see on the navle and whichever things I didn't have good notes for I made very brief summaries about them, especially pigs and chickens. I didn't find the vet prep questions helpful for me personally. I mostly utilized their learning pages. Of course the majority of the exam is dog and cat oriented, but I made sure to go in also being super comfortable with ruminants and horses."
EdenMyers,"So.... back in like, the early Cretaceous when I was in school (not at Purdue) it was very similar. Everyone sleeping with each other were used to after three years of it- students, faculty, faculty spouses- you name a combination, it happened. The insane work load (we were expected to staff the wards overnight in addition to 8am classes AND 12-14 hr days in the clinic) we could deal with.   
The toxic behaviour not so much. My class sued a couple of our profs, I think, and got one thrown out of the classroom for sexual harassment, though he kept his job. So it has been done.   
These days, knowing what I know now, I would urge you and your classmates to go the state and federal regulatory route. Call OSHA. Call your state radiation permit/oversight agency. Hell, call the labor dept and ACLU over the pregnancy thing. Filing complaints with the site visit team is a little more fraught, but might carry more weight or yield more immediate results.   
Also totally a legit course to simply put your head down and grind if that is what you need to do to get out. It sounds like you're to the point where you feel you have to take action though. Whatever you choose to do, good luck, and thanks for caring and wanting to make the situation better in the future!|Thirty years in practice. Seen this way more than once.

PootyWheat,"I wouldn‚Äôt take it personally at all. It‚Äôs human nature to be hesitant to relinquish control, especially to a new team member, in a situation where you or others could be hurt. With time, and enough smaller chances to demonstrate your skill, you will earn that trust.

I asked  our uni ambulatory service if I can ride along a few times a month but apparently the trucks are too full with actual vet students, so I'm working on asking some dairy practices in the area if they'd have me. 

This all started the other day when I had a particularly bad day preg checking. I was doing very poorly and this little voice in my head kept going ""What kind of dairy vet are you if you can't preg check?""

It's a skill I have struggled with since I first learned, and frankly it's a sore spot with me.|Thank you so much, this was actually a kickass pep talk :\*)|USA. Midline.

ReindeerVarious3024,"I‚Äôm a human doctor who has fostered many a dog, and this is eye opening to me. I had no idea it was illegal to administer vaccines to animals, and while I haven‚Äôt done it myself, I also can‚Äôt say I have ever actually looked into the topic. I have, however, been around others (also human doctors in the field of rescue work) who I absolutely witnessed giving injections to puppies/dogs that would come through the rescues we worked with. The vaccines from what I recall were provided by the rescue, but I may be mistaken. Otherwise I have no idea where/how the actual vaccine was obtained. On another note, I was often provided with human medications for dogs, and had to adjust dose based on weight. I assumed these meds all come from the same pharmacy and that there likely wasn‚Äôt actual differences in the meds based on human vs dog prescription. I do understand splitting pills doesn‚Äôt mean a standard dose will be obtained, but also thought nothing of it as I always had to split pills that were prescribed for the dogs specifically as well.

butterstherooster,"Most clinics don't care if you have tattoos.The ones that do simply say wear a light jacket over or a long sleeved shirt under your scrubs.

-spython-,"I went to uni in the UK where they teach flank in lectures, but did all my EMS in the USA/Canada so all my practical training was in the midline approach. I've only ever done midline in practice, but everywhere I've worked I'm usually the only vet using the midline approach in cat spays. 

I've also only ever seen other vets do a pre-scrotal approach to dog castrates in the UK (and that's what I was taught in uni), but I learned both pre-scrotal and scrotal techniques in the US.

Vet nurses are able to administer treatments prescribed by a veterinary surgeon under their direction, but they are not permitted to diagnose, recommend treatments, or prescribe. 

There are already many UK companies that offer these services, including Cloud 9 Vets who are nation-wide, and various mobile vets who cover smaller areas. Many vets are attracted to mobile vet practice, including palliative and end of life care, because they enjoy the longer appointment times, better flexibility and work life balance, and being able to support pets and guardians through this emotional and difficult time.|Most of the UK schools have a large graduate-entry program tailored to American applicants.

Melancholic-Moose,"And increasing the spots in existing programs. They claim it's to train rural mixed and large animal practice vets, but then have a. no way of making sure people actually go into those communities, b. don't adequately prepare people for that type of practice (so much small animal, minimal everything else), and c. where are these practices even? Not like you can start your own with the considerable loan burden after graduation. Just a tuition money grab I'm convinced.|I don't have a dual degree but I did do a PhD prior starting vet school.

I'm 35 and somehow older than some of the instructors and I also have more education than some of them (I was a research scientist in agriculture first and have a PhD, while also working part time still in the horse industry).

Not saying it's not important. I'm angry because we sound like condensing idiots talking to our ""clients"". I would never ever comfort someone by saying ""I can see that this is frustrating and hard for you to understand"". So it makes me rageful when I'm stopped and asked to reword into something that makes me sound like a grade A asshole. 

For what it's worth, people are mostly crying because someone cuts you off every 3 seconds and tells you to start again and I think they just get frustrated. The ones that cry during euthanasia conversations etc. are different. 

But point taken.|Not CSU, I'm in Canada. But I have heard that our communications programs are very similar.|Oh absolutely! I would also say things similar to what you mentioned. We are forced to add a I can see (hear or feel) on the start of all statements like that and end in ""for you"" so everything just comes out condescending.

BBG1308,"High speed scanners make quick work of this.

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients. Deal with paper charts for the ones that are enormous or are likely to pass soonish or may never come back. Pay someone else to scan the rest. You still have to have someone (you or a well-trained tech) to read the record and enter any necessary database info.|> I also see many people saying RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way.

It doesn't count at all towards a four year graduate degree in veterinary medicine.  But veterinary students usually complete a four year bachelor's degree prior to applying to veterinary school.  

If the RVT program is at an accredited institution such as a community college, some of their credits can be transferred to a four year university and may help them achieve their bachelor's in less than four full years.

RVT school is primarily a vocational program. Thus the ""T"" for technician. They don't diagnose or prescribe.

Don't get me wrong. RVTs are worth their weight in gold. But it's a completely different level of education and type of training than what a veterinarian receives."
croissantsplease,"üëèüëèüëè|Ultimately, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how to feel, but‚Ä¶.

To give you some perspective, I‚Äôm applying to vet school this year, I‚Äôm in my 30s and came from the humanities/education/research. It‚Äôs taken 2 years to get the experience and prereqs needed for veterinary school, it is quite the process! BUT, I came in because I LOVE medicine, and slowly found my way to this over time. I find working in a clinic very rewarding, but damn, there are also days that tear your heart out. You can‚Äôt save them all in vet med, and it just sucks- the worst are the terrible clients who can pay but let their animals suffer because they don‚Äôt care. And there‚Äôs really not much we can do about that. I say all this not to say you shouldn‚Äôt do it, but I think your passion may be in a different aspect of veterinary/shelter medicine that is SO NEEDED. For example, in many states , low cost spay/neuter funding goes underutilized because the process it apply for grants is so top-heavy that vets (at least the ones I know have said this) give up out of frustration. There is real, valuable skills you could bring with your current passions- if they involve school, great! But they don‚Äôt HAVE to. Best of luck, definitely try to do some shadowing in a clinic to get a feel before taking the plunge.|I am applying to veterinary school this year and some family members look at me oddly when I say that I feel really passionate about a couple things, including oncology and end-of-life care.

fuckhead,"I'm sorry you are dealing with this. My wife is a first year vet and is dealing with the same thing. Some of the techs are even insisting on doing blatantly wrong and/or outdated things over my wife's objections. The craziest part is that my wife was a tech for 2 years before she went to vet school. Her school had a ""best student"" award that is given at graduation based on a vote by the techs and staff and she even won that award. Now at her first actual job she's been getting hostility very similar to what you are experiencing. So it's not just you!

Are you a woman by chance? Based on talking to my wife and some of her vet friends it feels like there's a sexism element as well -- respect is ""earned"" faster by new male vets."

Additionally, has anyone seen the ER care decrease tremendously in the last years? Just transfered a case to Blue Pearl for a clear obstruction that I did not have time to cut myself, xrays and all. And they send it home with Cerenia. Came back couple of days later to resect some bowel.¬†|No we're not intimidated, but it's the hold times that kill us.

Zestyclose_Bass6602,"Current Mizzou student who absolutely loves the program!

Perks: 2+2 meaning 2 years didactics then 2 years clinics. The extra clinical experience was extremely helpful for navle prep. However this does mean more condensed course load at the start and you have shorter summers. 

Not many clinicians that I don‚Äôt love. The vast majority are fantastic teachers and very kind. Of course there‚Äôs always a few exceptions. 

Lots of elective time and off blocks in clinics that makes it easy to plan externships at other hospitals and feel out places you might want to work at. I definitely think this is more than most schools. From those I‚Äôve talked to some only get one to two weeks off campus but we have roughly 17 weeks of time off (do what you want externships or just chill, go on vacation) and 10 weeks of elective time all of which can be arranged to be off campus if you want. 

Oh and in state tuition after 1 year if you‚Äôre out of state was a big plus. It‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed as long as you meet specific requirements like earning $2,000 in the first year and staying in Missouri during your first summer (you‚Äôre allowed 14 days out of state during the summer months)

Overall I‚Äôve loved mizzou some rotations have larger time requirements than others but for the most part it‚Äôs been manageable.

Gold_Departure_9153,"\*Extremely Subjective opinion.\*

Honestly I started off with some mental health issues (depression, anxiety, severe lack of confidence/self doubt) that had basically been COMPLETELY stable for 5+ years. Vet school has completely reactivated them x1000, despite doing therapy and being on medication. I'm burnt out and despite passing boards and being near graduation, feel like this was a huge mistake and incompatible with my personality.

You can do vet school if you want. If I had to do it again, I would choose a different career. I would recommend this career to those who have had no to minimal mental health problems prior to vet school (bc most people will end up with them from how stressful this career is). 

Us mentally ill people can certainly do it, but there is a price to pay. The experience is harder because you are fighting more than just academic battles and fatigue. You can completely lose your self worth and identity if you are prone to these types of things.  Good luck and go with your heart.|What you are experiencing is completely normal. I commend you for talking about it. I promise so many of your classmates and graduated veterinarians feel that way, some just talk about it more than others. Very few people leave veterinary school not feeling this way at some point or another.

The shyness will get better with time, confidence, and knowledge base. Even if you are really shy, who cares. I have seen so many vets with horrible bedside manner (impatient, standoffish with client) and they are doing fine. Just advocate for your patient and have empathy for your clients and things will work out.

Not sure if it‚Äôs like this at other schools, but our surgery department is particularly bad. All of the clinicians and residents will outwardly talk about students and/or each other and it‚Äôs just so nasty. I can‚Äôt wait to graduate and never look back.

During those 2 weeks, I just did practice questions for all other species. Then I spent 2 more weeks on cats and reviewed dogs at the same time. Then I spent 2 weeks on bovine and reviewed horses at the same time. I mainly focused on the big 4 categories. Then the last 2 weeks I had of studying, I integrated exotics, pigs, poultry, and miscellaneous stuff like how to calculate sensitivity and specificity etc. into my study plan but continued to review the big 4 via questions and powerpages. Now, for these 8 weeks, I was on externships, electives, or off so I had a LOT of time to study (~5-8 hours a day).

They give you a salary range for every job advert, but most of them these days show anywhere between 50k to 65k/year for a gp small animal vet. New grads usually earn around 40-45k. I think (but this is my opinion), specialist salaries aren't listed anywhere because they are established on the job interview. If you want to go to UK to specialise, you have to remember that there is a ""road"" for that: 1-2 years in GP on new grad salary, then internship, which will be paid even lower, then residency then specialist. 

Also, if money is your priority, you can earn a lot in a short time span if you do locum work mainly in ECC, but in this case you will need a lot of medical experience under your belt.|I am not implying what they earn or don't earn. I am saying that the specialist salary is probably established on the interview at the referral they are working or about to work. 

What I am implying is that, if you are prioritizing how much you earn,  there are some ""fast"" ways to do that. Another thing I am implying is that, if you follow the specialising route, you will have to earn under the market value for a salary in the veterinary sector, for a while.|In short, don't give phenobarbitone, or long term anti epileptics in conditions that are caused by liver dysfunctions or are secondary to electrolyte/metabolic imbalances.

Some of those thermometers end up either in really silly places, either their battery has died, and due to time and budget constraints, ended up in the trash.

Same with the pens.

I have always felt like a failure that I couldn‚Äôt keep going on to residency, but I didn‚Äôt think I could manage any more of the system.  My treatment during internship was so appalling, that I now actually feel anxious taking my own animals to a vet clinic. Trying to explain this to other people is impossible.

But plan carefully and reconsider your timeline. 

3-4 years to finish undergrad/your pre req classes.

4 years of vet school. 

1-2 years of internship.

3 year radiology residency. 

So you could definitely be a DVM in 10 years if you start college right away with a full time student course-load, but not a board certified specialist. You may not get into vet school your first attempt, many don't. And radiology is a competitive residency so you could do 1, 2, 3 year internship years with no guarantee of a match.

I'm a senior in HS who goes to an Agricultural HS and I have taken veterinary classes and I LOVE it. I find it fascinating.

Nocranberry,"Setting boundaries. We talk about work-life balance all the time, but it really can be make or break in health industries. It's really important to be able to leave work at work. So turning off work chats, avoiding animal related social media, and knowing when to say, ""hey that non-urgent consult needs to be moved because I'm still dealing with cases x, y and z"". Bonus points if you can afford to live on a 4 day work week. That way, you're more okay to deal with long shifts as you've got that extra day to catch up on rest and to do nothing.

Use your leave. You don't have to go anywhere or do anything with it, but use it. I personally use mine to make sure I have the day off for friends and families birthdays as that's what's important to me, and there's been too many times when I've had to miss something because we've had an emergency come in 5 minutes to close. I enjoy my work, but the people in my home life still come first. Sometimes, I take a few days off just to spend time at home with my own animals as a mental refresher.

Counselling: even if you're feeling mentally okay. Sometimes you're going to get something wrong, or something might die and you'll question everything you did and it's important to be able to frame your thinking in a way that's helpful to move forward rather than detrimental.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you're just one person and you can't look after your patients if you don't look after yourself first.|The main thing is; if you're not sure about anything, just ask questions.

Depends on if you're out front or out back at the moment, but familiarise yourself with the flea and worm treatments the clinic sells, and find out the clinic protocol on desexing (what age / weight they need to be, how long after heat / labour before they can be booked in) and that will help you cover about 50% of the client facing things"

Show time üôÉ"
rememberjanuary,"While money should be the main factor in considering a school, you need to also realize that if you don't accept this school, you may never get an acceptance to vet school in the future.|Being a veterinarian is a good career, but you have to be in it pretty much 100%. If you're not, it will suck your soul out of you. It still might even if it's everything you've ever wanted it to be. If you can't see yourself doing anything else then do it, but recognize it has a lot of downsides too (just as any career).

The first thing is definitely the income to debt ratio. I'm in Canada and my debt to income ratio after graduating was approximately 1:1. That's manageable. But in the US where it can often be 3:1 or even 4:1, you need to seriously consider things. Salaries are getting better but it's no physician salary, not even close. Some specialists can make 300k plus, but as someone in residency right now that is a LOT of work.

The second thing is that this career is emotionally taxing. It asks that you give all of your emotional self to others. Giving it to your patients is great and you can really see their appreciation when you help them. But not all clients are as grateful, agreeable, or available. Vet med has a high attrition rate.

If you do consider vet med seriously consider careers outside general practice. It may not be your ideal career working for government, or food safety, or epidemiology, but salaries are still quite good and you don't have as many stresses, or at least not the same kind.

I will say that the DVM is an incredibly useful degree and I've been privileged enough to have some wonderful experiences through my training and met some amazing people. But you need to consider the whole picture. In fact, if you do consider applying, this kind of knowledge is going to make you a more attractive candidate in interviews.

Best of luck!|I think you'll find the cost comparable to most OOS school tuition in the US. And sometimes it's easier to get into too, just because not everyone considers them. There are two schools in Canada offering non citizens spots: OVC and AVC. WCVM may be now as well. Montreal does but is only in French.|Veterinary medicine is the kind of career that doesn't end when the work day ends. You bring a lot of that home with you. Sometimes it's actual work, reports and case logs, and other times it is mental anguish.

It also is not worth it if you're going to school in the USA and pay obscene amounts of tuition. The pay just isn't high enough to justify the debt. And the debt also plays a role in mental health.

I had OCD going into vet school and I really struggled with balancing study and my mental health and at one point I was at my lowest ever mental health point.

I've switched directions in vet med now to diagnostics and it's a much better balance, but still a huge time commitment.

In some ways I wish animals were still my hobby or their only purpose was companionship.

You can certainly make it through vetmed and have a fulfilling life but I don't think most people can do that and still have good mental health. Even in residency there are days off where I just sleep the whole day. That's not really living.

You'll find a career you enjoy enough, but is also financially viable.|Yeah the DVM is a stupid useful degree. And after 300-400k in debt you are going to put yourself and your family in incredible economic hardship.|That's definitely a hardship and I'm sorry you have to bear it. But think about what will happen if you don't finish your degree and get that power of independence if you want. You'll be in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt working what kind of job? Stuck with what kind of husband? This is an opportunity for you and your kids to prosper.

As the other commenters have said, even if you never go into clinical practice there are a boat load of jobs you can get with a DVM still paying great salaries.

And Sask and Manitoba generally have lower GPA requirements for WCVM.|If you're already on loans then an extra 500 bucks for one of the prep courses is a drop in the bucket and a good investment. There are people that study without it, but it's basically a pay to win system and would be incredibly helpful to use those resources.|The ICVA practice tests are a confidence interval. It's a 95% CI meaning that if you take the test 20 times, 19 of your scores would be within that range, and then 2.5% of them either below or above that. It doesn't tell you your chances at a pass or fail unless your interval is completely above or below the pass cut off respectively.

Mine was accurate I guess. I got higher than it predicted so that was a 2.5% chance.

VetPrep says something like 95% of people that get to 80% completion in the program will pass the NAVLE. That's as far as I went.|I don't remember. Maybe it was after you have written the exam. In any case that's the only way you'd get a range like that."
SmallFist,The fake reviews were removed from their Google maps page.   I think a lot of vet med staff reported the reviews (I did and got a friend to as well).
H8N4S8N,"I knew I've been desensitized, but I thought I was just a cold heartless bitch. Now I know it's not just me. I work in ER now and damn you really don't get time. It just numbs you, yakno? When I first started I cried aaallllll the time. Now it's hard to even pretend to be sad. I'm just numb.|Thanks OP. I really needed to hear that today."
paintandwar,"How come you don‚Äôt remove dewclaws? Sorry if this sounds ignorant, I don‚Äôt mean to. I‚Äôve adopted a dog who already had the dewclaws removed, I honestly know nothing of it but when I looked it up it says that it helps protect against injuries and getting caught in stuff, I guess? Is this true? 
(For reference she is an Australian Shepherd, so perhaps it was removed for work reasons I‚Äôm not sure.)|That makes a lot of sense! It seems totally unnecessary. Funny how the internet makes it seem like such a ""common problem"" that has to be ""taken care of.""

Thank you for your time!"
