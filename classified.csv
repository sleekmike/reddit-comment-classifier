ExcellentHoney8663,my sympathy for your loss in my experience if you can be covered in clean animal poop piss blood vomit and or drool with a smile can be polite to clients and can restrain safely then you have job security get the tattoo if you feel that you want it,Other
OhBlackWater,before serious consideration of applying to veterinary school you need to work or at least volunteer at an animal hospital to get a better appreciation of the work and day to day life of a veterinarian aside from getting a better understanding a competitive applicant has many hours myself 10 000 when i was admitted but i m not a normal applicant experience under the supervision of a veterinarian i will say that s a satisfying bandage,Other

MooCowMoooo,have you considered in home euthanasia people who work for lap of love always seem very happy and fulfilled i looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if i burn out again relief is also the reason i m finally happy with the career if you asked me in my first 5 years if it was worth it i would have said absolutely not relief work allows you freedom to avoid the many clinics that will work you to death it pays well you don t have to deal with the usual clinic drama and people are grateful that you are there helping unfortunately you probably need to do some regular gp for a couple of years before you do relief to get experience and feel comfortable as a solo practitioner have you considered in home euthanasia people who work for lap of love always seem very happy and fulfilled i looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if i burn out again i have heard polarizing opinions on one hand people say they love it they get paid very well the,Other
dmaxd123,120k is a lot of nice vacations you have to have the right mental headspace to enjoy veterinary medicine i know vets who were out of debt in less than 10 years 5ish i think i know vets who save their money to pay the taxes on the long term forgiveness stuff i know vets who hate the job but they are often unhappy in other parts of their life and are looking for a unicorn job that honestly doesn t exist for 99 of graduates and i know vets who love the job might not always love their employer but ultimately do their job enjoy their job collect their pay and enjoy their life if you want a relaxed life i would explore the army track to see what they cover and what the commitment is it might be a faster way to get out of debt as the dr pol lifestyle isn t necessarily a realistic life of a country vet and a shelter isn t exactly a lucrative bill paying position either you can make a great career as a small animal vet in the country but without a tv contract you need to work build a clinic that either has higher margins or higher volume both can eat away at the relaxing country life that many envision,Other
Solerian,yes i think my favorite thing is getting them to trust you and understand you re just trying to help them it breaks my heart to see them fearful and anxious from past experiences i always try to give them lots of love and treats if possible definitely market yourself as someone excited to learn and willing to stay in the field not just someone who kind of wants to do it lack of experience is hard because lots of places instantly reject if they see you re without experience if they won t take you for anything try interning or shadowing somewhere and see if you can eventually make your way in definitely put whatever animal experience you have on your resume it will at least show you ve been with animals before and can handle them,Other
step1step2profit,for cardio the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program i haven t been in the match for awhile but it seems like interns from csu tufts ohio tamu nc state and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency so i can t answer your question about externship vs research program directly go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship that being said while it s great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician it s also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects not just cardiology the specialty world is small and it is not uncommon for residency committees to reach out to friends in non cardiology specialists to ask about candidates unofficially,Other

Morgwino,not vetco but i worked for a mobile vet as a clinic assistant yeah its quite rushed the ones i worked at a slow clinic was 15 in 90 minutes corporate wanted us taking less than 3 minutes from check in to walking out you would be paid extra if you had to stay over but ffom what i heard you would have to defend your decision explain why it took longer mostly the supervisor would do this but occasionally id hear a vet haf to do so,Other

Material_Boot6044,i took my first gap year on purpose by not applying vet school and going to work at a small animal practice i took my second gap year because i was wait listed but got in the next year i m so grateful for my gap years planned and unplanned because they gave me the opportunity to gain clinical experience great relationships reference letters and money all have been very beneficial during my vet school years and i feel like a learned a lot about myself while not in school i will be graduating in may and going on to complete an internship then ecc residency i don t personally understand why gap years are stigmatized and would do everything the same way that makes me nervous i didn t decide to persue an internship until later in my fourth year after all of my externship time was filled i have reached out to current interns but that has been the extent of my communications with these programs 3 86 and 35 128,Other
MackeDaddy,petvet suckssssss even on a gp level they re all about increasing prices and pushing employees to their limit to see everything that walks in the door even if the clinic isn t equipped for it nva is a joke too they gave gift cards but taxed em out of your paycheck they wanted to give employees something tangible but still had to report to irs yeah i left pv shortly after the cards came up still haven t received mine from november and i doubt i ever will and to comment on your other reply idk what the governors could really do since it s an independent corp or if theyd even feel a need to do anything human nurses had to unionize to get the pay they are at and it s still not enough for what they do i feel like more people should be aware of the good and bad vet corps out there it d limit the amount of people they d be able to screw over it probably wouldn t hurt to reach out and see what options they offer as far as that goes i don t have much knowledge on that but i understand everyone s experience with most corporate businesses is mostly clinic based and not all clinics under a corporation are bad negative i have enjoyed most of the people i ve met through petvet but i ve enjoyed being out of petvet so much more there are better corps out there that genuinely take steps to put their employees first but there s always pros and cons anywhere you go and everyone s thresholds are different,Other

Boleana,i m not a vet i just had this sub randomly pop up in my feed and i find it interesting so here i am i recently adopted a 7 year old frenchie and we ve been at the vet a lot with him figuring out different things with him i really appreciate how much time our vet spends with us and explaining things we never feel rushed or pressured into anything yeah stuff is expensive but i fully trust he s looking out for our little guy and doing what s in his best interest i just had to say i m sure the clients you spend extra time with really appreciate it thanks for doing what you do,Other
PureBreadTed,i m also worried about coming across as unprofessional if i show emotion during a pet euthanasia i can t speak to how you ll come across in vet school i ve also only been in this industry for a few months that being said in this time i work at an urgent care i ve seen two vets cry due to completely heart wrenching cases first case was with a new to us vet this case was not euthanasia but unfortunately ended similarly the dog came in limping we d administered pain meds via iv iirc and the dog immediately went into arrest we attempted cpr but were unsuccessful when we broke the news to his owner it was gut wrenching we were all in tears because it was completely unexpected dr later says he believes the limping was due to a clot and we may have unfortunately pushed the clot out of position while giving meds leading to cardiopulmonary arrest second case was a euth an older dog came in because she got cut on the farm she was a farm dog at the point the finally came in she d been bleeding for over five hours and had stalled her owners t shirt in an attempt to help her clot our dr was immediately suspicious and asked about rat poison owner called a family member who was able to check and she did unfortunately get into it while we were waiting to hear back from aspca poison control so we could transfer her to er our dr was demonstrating how to use an ultrasound for a new tech the dr realized there was a lot of free floating liquid in her abdomen dr asked to do an x ray because she was older and intact she unfortunately had pyometra however the owner was willing to pay for the expensive surgery so she is good right wrong by happenstance the x ray also captured nodes on her lungs the owner had no idea she had cancer this case was heart wrenching because despite our best efforts and an owners willingness to do whatever it took to get her better she wouldn t be able to do so in the end we were all feeling it because it felt like everything was against this sweet girl getting better my point here is it is normal to have emotions in this job we can t always be stoic like it doesn t affect us those emotions make us human and show we care about the animals we are looking after,Veterinarian

prinkly,wow this is a really comprehensive link thank you,Other
emtrnmd,this is how it is in the human medical world too it s probably because the seasoned techs seasoned nurses have more clinical experience and a better understanding of certain concepts but if they re blatantly disrespecting you i would say something you saying something might end up with them just mocking you but healthcare seems to be like a prove that you aren t a moron type of field across the board i wish people were open to leaning on one another despite titles i m a registered nurse and some of the residents i deal with are literally incompetent one actually got into a fight with a seasoned nurse about an ekg and then continued to fight with the attending about even though he was wrong it s a dog eat dog world man,Medical Doctor

TheNicestRedditor,so at this point if we haven t heard from florida colorado wisconsin are the chances pretty low they re interested i think everyone should reach out to their states department of agriculture trade and consumer protection to file a complaint r hailcorporate i agree i m essentially a glorified data engineer and if this was only impacting a few exam reports this would have been resolved already this is clearly a massive systemic issue and with 8 500 candidates i don t see how they can resolve it today unless they ve got a large number of resources they can assign to it i wonder if the people that saw theirs is still valid maybe they got someone else s results too i d feel even worse if i saw i passed and then ended up having the wrong results lol this is not just a privacy issue but a licensing issue the datcp handles all licensing for veterinarians file with both if you can i d be very surprised if something like that would cause such a systemic issue and if so that would be a major security breach i would hope that would be readily identifiable to the dba my guess is something happened along the line of icvaid matching to test id which makes me feel like even the people that saw their results might not have the correct information even if their name and id matched on the report i just read for the nov 1 dec 16 session there were only 6 500 candidates i d bet they have a few people going through each report manually to match everything up i just don t see how they can resolve this in a day or two or how candidates can even trust this is accurate as others have stated delaying results can have significant impact to these candidates careers dr heather case needs to be heavily questioned about this there s a number of high level dvms that sit on the bod for icva and the fact that they re all at a conference together and have not made a formal statement is troubling what s your gpa and class rank gonna be very competitive as others have said many will have done research and externships as well solid gpa and rank though those are definitely highly desired schools and have not heard bad things about any of them good luck,Other

Mediocre-Jelly-7625,hi yes thank you i did get a few interviews where they said that they would be unable to hire me for only 3 1 2 months which was kinda upsetting since i already stated that in my cover letter and they just made me sit through an interview i reached out to many vet clinics for shadowing experiences since i was in high school and none of them want people to shadow i don t know what to do because i need veterinary hours so far i only have around 330 hours in animal experience,Other

feather-duster-cat,i won t repeat what was already said but just wanted to suggest getting some experience in the field before diving head first into this path working in vet is sometimes not what people think it is and i d hate for you to do all this work just to discover this isn t something you like after all if after working volunteering in the field you still want to go ahead then absolutely it s possible keep in mind regarding tuition you may end up needing to go to a school other than the one you have free tuition for vet school so i wouldn t write that aspect off altogether i mark mine with one colour of nailpolish doesn t wreck the instrument and can be removes if needed but also doesn t come off with washing etc this might not be true for vet related jobs so take this with a grain of salt but when i moved to the states with my family patents were coming for a sponsored job it took us over 2 years to get our green cards we did have visas in the interim however i d be shocked if green cards came through in 2 months personally but again this was almost 10 years ago so things could be different want to double down on the fact that there s less petty unnecessarily competitive general crazy prevet vet student vibes has made the world of difference for me coming from a very competitive prevet undergrad to an environment now where everyone isn t out for each others throats disclaimer not rvc i m at melbourne but a nearly identical age multiple entry route situation there s an official process to go through if you think having an accommodation of some sort will be required for you to write the test i d look into that on the website and see if it would apply to you as itbsounds like it might,Other

hikeswithdogs420,i ve worked for a corporately owned vet and 2 privately owned vet hospitals the privately owned hospitals were very different than the corporate one i would be very hesitant to ever take a job at another corporately owned hospital as they seem to mainly just care of money prices were higher management was awful pay was pretty terrible and the employee discount wasnt very great either one of the private hospitals i worked at payed pretty well but management was terrible finding a smaller privately owned hospital was a god send for me they 100 care more about the patients clients as well as employees it can be tough to find a non toxic work environment when your working in vet med but it s worth searching for i was at my last hospital for 7 years and it had become very toxic the manager would throw temper tantrums and only cared about money including when it came down to your own personal pets i spent about 6 months searching and asking tons of questions to potential new employers and finally found a small privately owned practice with 100 employee discount let me tell you chances are if they re taking good care of their employees they re going to take good care of their patients as well,Other

TrainerLass,perfectly healthy animals die during routine procedures it can take one bad experience to lead a practice to require bw and x rays before anesthesia if an owner doesn t want that much security they can go to their local non profit also true but it happens some clinics prefer to cover their asses by requiring testing while others leave it optional there are options available for all incomes and situations which is great however saying that it s astonishing that someone pays x amount for a procedure is unnecessary if your mental health is suffering don t feel guilty about moving on full stop the veterinary field has had high turnover for years it s life it may be incredibly rewarding but there s a lot of shit and toxic people to deal with and it s not for everyone i ve been practicing for 15 years and i would never advise anyone to start in an emergency facility i love it but it can be pretty twisted interview at a few gps and i m sure you ll find an atmosphere that is more pleasing there are gps that suck too so keep applying until you find a good fit if this is really something you want to do it s worth the effort,Other

m00-shroom,this is a complete guess but maybe another thing along the lines of it not being diluted properly do you dilute it in a huge batch at night then pour it in individual bottles in the morning maybe the rescue separates a bit at night and then when you re pouring in the bottles the concentration is stronger hmm that s not an especially strong solution seems right it could be that you re getting the irritation from the concentrated stuff while you re diluting it i e some of it sprays up while you re pouring i m not sure i m hoping someone else here will know a bit more about it i just know that when i was a kennel assistant i often had irritation on my hands arms from all the chemicals and i didn t like rescue in particular because it was so strong stay safe friend hope you figure it out,Other

Gravelroadmom2,the next sentence expanded on the subject a young vet i know is active on instagram and daily she post photos of clients pets in various stages of anesthesia recovery from a procedure often shows the stitches none of these photos are on the clinic s social media sites she s going to be in a world of hurt if a sensitive client ever sees bootsie s photos used without permission at clinics where i worked we happily gave out spay neuter castration estimates over the phone with the caveat that if they find something on the pre surgical exam the fee could up a need for a radiograph lab etc i wouldn t use a practice that required an exam to get the fee quote the difference in fees is wild my solo practice vet charged a low exam fee because she didn t want an exam fee to be a barrier to clients pets who needed to be seen all meds labs were 100 mark up radiographs were 90 a view she moved away and my new solo practice vet charges a an exam fee 20 more than previous vet but meds are sold at about 5 more than ordering from a well known public vendor the new vet ends up costing less because the meds aren t marked up so high one practice in the high money area requires full blood panel and chest x rays for all spay neuters regardless of the pets age that s a 250 fee before the pet is sedated for spay neuter i ve scrubbed in for so many cat neuters and it s astonishing that some is going to spend 350 for a cat neuter that is 100 correct the odds of a young animal healthy on physical exam being one of those that dies is slim and yes non profits perform a valuable affordable service in reducing reproduction in pets so do gp clinics that don t require those test it s an observation from working in a clinic that did not require them and taking phone calls at the clinic from people who were quoted 300 to neuter a 6 month old kitten your vet will do a thorough palpitation of your pet feeling for abnormalities examine the eyes ears listen to the heart lungs and have you tell them what preventative products you use heartworm flea tick and what if any other meds the pet is on your pet will have been weighed and if it s fat or trending towards fat then the pets diet exercise will be discussed in human medicine patients now have 24 7 access to labs summary of visit etc done by their doctor i m not sure why a veterinarian would charge to reissue vax certificate at best make a clear policy that the first one is included with the visit additional copies cost x amount it may be your location 45 minutes outside a major metro area can turn into a very rural area where youngish vets may not be interested in living texas is a wonderful state and each region has its own identity east verses west texas the hill country panhandle a daughter lives in san antonio and it s wonderful for such a large city with plenty of things to do or just chill out by a pool austin dallas fort worth traffic can be a hassle to navigate houston is a refinery city i think if you lived 45 minutes outside any of those metro areas you would be pleased big city offerings just a short drive away but day to day life in a smaller city as a woman just out of reproductive age i hope texas corrects the current flaw with the law no one should experience what kate cox went through and it would be great if the president would stop the illegal crossings in texas at the border illegal immigrants are an issue nationwide not legal immigrants have the babies the vet work will always be there in the future i wonder about how her work day is managed is she double booked is no time for working on patient records built into her day or does staff not respect that time and interrupt her does she keep her scheduled appointments moving along cornerstone is a good product if she selects to enter her records into it,Veterinarian

Prestigious_Wheel128,breeders do know a lot and combined with the medical background and simple prescription is it really that bad it s not stroking any egos though youre going to read my comments you know who doesnt have this much free time medical doctors inability to afford treatment euthanasias arguably a convenience euthanasia is the work life balance reasonable theres this stupid old wives tale going around where you shouldn t go into vet med if you love animals because you have to put them down and im like if it makes sense to put them down thats compassionate to the animal so i assumed they re talking about convenience euthanasia but it doesn t sound like that s common at all so it sounds like vetmed might be a good career for someone who loves animals thats how it should be imo puts vets in an uncomfortable ethical position still the ethics are pretty black and white imo its the money that complicates things imagine if we did that to people the ethics are pretty clear its the money that complicated things yep never been through something like that it sounds horrible i wish there was a solution but everything i can think of seems flawed it is pretty black and white the money is what complicates things being good at your job is only say 50 of the work world the other 50 is intra office politics an extremely useful skill in life is to learn how to get people on your side and this sounds like a really interesting opportunity to learn this ask their input even if you dont do what they want it makes them feel valuable remember birthdays and holidays make jokes and try to connect with them obviously these people could be absolute jerks and thats straight up a toxic workplace youre in but its worth looking inward first and trying all you can to connect with them what do you mean you don t get any satisfaction,Other
