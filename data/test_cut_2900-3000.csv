ExcellentHoney8663,"My sympathy for your loss. In my experience, if you can be covered in / clean animal poop, piss, blood, vomit and/or drool with a smile, can be polite to clients and can restrain safely then you have job security. Get the tattoo if you feel that you want it."
OhBlackWater,"Before serious consideration of applying to veterinary school: you need to work or at least volunteer at an animal hospital to get a better appreciation of the work and day-to-day life of a veterinarian. 

Aside from getting a better understanding, a competitive applicant has many hours (myself 10,000+ when i was admitted but I'm not a normal applicant) experience under the supervision of a veterinarian.|I will say that's a satisfying bandage"

I think I heard that the earliest would be the 16th because that‚Äôs a month after the last test day. But I have a feeling that it will be closer to the end of January!|I know!! I‚Äôm trying to stay positive but also don‚Äôt want to give myself false hope lol|Yes I saw this how annoying!! I was hoping they would have it fixed by end of day today but I‚Äôm not sure we will be getting scores today.|Yes I felt like the time constraint was a lot different than any of the practice tests. So I also felt like I was having to rush through the test and am scared that I just made too many stupid mistakes.

MooCowMoooo,"Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.|Relief is also the reason I‚Äôm finally happy with the career. If you asked me in my first 5 years if it was worth it, I would have said absolutely not. Relief work allows you freedom to avoid the many clinics that will work you to death. It pays well, you don‚Äôt have to deal with the usual clinic drama, and people are grateful that you are there helping.

Unfortunately, you probably need to do some regular GP for a couple of years before you do relief, to get experience and feel comfortable as a solo practitioner.|Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.|I have heard polarizing opinions.

On one hand, people say they love it. They get paid very well. The fact that clients see everything seems to be a benefit as they can see pets being triaged and better understand why they have to wait.

On the other hand, I‚Äôve heard that the culture is ridiculous and the vet is expected to take every phone call because clients are told they can always reach a doctor. Even if that means taking a phone call to talk about flea control while scrubbed into surgery. 

I‚Äôm intrigued by them, but I don‚Äôt think I could do my job with clients watching my every move. And I get a lot of cult vibes from them. The people who love it seem so devoted and seem to have nothing bad to say. And the matching t shirts at the conferences. If a documentary came out in 10 years about it being a cult, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked üòÇ|Do you feel you have enough experience to work alone? If so, I recommend trying relief work for a while. I found it less stressful and you can get a good feel for a lot of different clinics in the area. I found my current job by starting as relief there.

I finally experienced what it‚Äôs like to not imagine the worst case scenario and second guess every decision I made at work.|Switching to relief saved my career. It‚Äôs good money, keeps things fresh and interesting, everyone is appreciative of you, and the daily staff drama doesn‚Äôt grind you down.

I have a friend who does relief through VetIQ which seems like a good option if you need benefits. I haven‚Äôt tried them, but they seem very flexible (you can work anywhere from once to 5 times a week, and can choose to knock all your days out at the beginning of the month, then take the rest of the month off). They pay a base salary, even if they don‚Äôt have a shift for you, and they offer health insurance, CE, and other benefits.|You just have to stop caring. It sucks for the pet, but you‚Äôll drive yourself insane if you try to convince these people. They‚Äôve already made up their minds. I had a lady last week refuse to give Nexgard to her dog because the weight range was too wide and she couldn‚Äôt believe a 25# dog could get the same dose as a 60# dog. I did my best, but if she wants to live in a flea infested house, that‚Äôs not on me."
dmaxd123,"120K is a lot of nice vacations|You have to have the right mental headspace to enjoy veterinary medicine.  I know vets who were out of debt in less than 10 years (5ish I think) I know vets who save their money to pay the taxes on the long term forgiveness stuff.   I know vets who hate the job but they are often unhappy in other parts of their life and are looking for a unicorn job that honestly doesn't exist for 99% of graduates and I know vets who love the job, might not always love their employer but ultimately do their job, enjoy their job, collect their pay and enjoy their life|if you want a relaxed life I would explore the army track to see what they cover and what the commitment is, it might be a faster way to get out of debt as the Dr Pol lifestyle isn't necessarily a realistic life of a country vet and a shelter isn't exactly a lucrative bill paying position either.

you can make a great career as a small animal vet in the country, but without a TV contract you need to work/build a clinic that either has higher margins or higher volume both can eat away at the ""relaxing"" country life that many envision"
Solerian,"Yes, I think my favorite thing is getting them to trust you and understand you‚Äôre just trying to help them. It breaks my heart to see them fearful and anxious from past experiences. I always try to give them lots of love (and treats if possible)!|Definitely market yourself as someone excited to learn and willing to stay in the field, not just someone who kind of wants to do it. Lack of experience is hard because lots of places instantly reject if they see you‚Äôre without experience. If they won‚Äôt take you for anything, try interning or shadowing somewhere and see if you can eventually make your way in. 

Definitely put whatever animal experience you have on your resume, it will at least show you‚Äôve been with animals before and can handle them."
step1step2profit,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.

That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology. The specialty world is small and it is not uncommon for residency committees to reach out to friends in non-cardiology specialists to ask about candidates (unofficially)."
Pretend-Platypus9287,I‚Äôm 31 and my daughter is 3 months and I‚Äôm going back to work part time in a month. Never thought I‚Äôd want to go part time to stay home with my daughter but I‚Äôm so excited! I‚Äôm ready to move on from vet med being my entire identity and into my mom era üòÜ
FUmods89,"Great question and important to consider all options. I stopped working when my two kids were little, and went back pt when they started school. Hard but good decision for me; raising kids is stressful (as is vet med). And‚Ä¶can‚Äôt get those early years back!"
Realistic_Ad559,Yes you can! Several vets I know have done that! That honestly helps reduce interest rates too
TaroFearless7930,That's a great idea. I'll be sure to do it now.
Morgwino,"Not vetco but I worked for a mobile vet as a clinic assistant. Yeah its quite rushed. The ones I worked at a slow clinic was <15 in 90 minutes, corporate wanted us taking less than 3 minutes from check in to walking out. You would be paid extra if you had to stay over but ffom what I heard you would have to defend your decision/explain why it took longer (mostly the supervisor would do this, but occasionally id hear a vet haf to do so)"
Fair_Inevitable_2650,I would be worried if your patients need aftercare for euthanasia appointmentsüòâ
Material_Boot6044,"I took my first gap year on purpose by not applying vet school and going to work at a small animal practice. I took my second gap year because I was wait listed, but got in the next year. I'm so grateful for my gap years (planned and unplanned) because they gave me the opportunity to gain clinical experience, great relationships/reference letters, and money. All have been very beneficial during my vet school years and I feel like a learned a lot about myself while not in school. I will be graduating in May and going on to complete an internship then ECC residency. I don't personally understand why gap years are stigmatized and would do everything the same way.|That makes me nervous.

MackeDaddy,"PetVet suckssssss. Even on a GP level. They're all about increasing prices and pushing employees to their limit to see everything that walks in the door.

NVA is a joke too.|They gave gift cards but taxed em out of your paycheck. üòâ they wanted to give employees ""something tangible"" but still had to report to IRS.|Yeah, I left PV shortly after the cards came up. Still haven't received mine from November, and I doubt I ever will. And to comment on your other reply, idk what the governors could really do since it's an independent Corp. Or if theyd even feel a need to do anything. Human nurses had to unionize to get the pay they are at, and it's still not enough for what they do. 

I feel like more people should be aware of the good and bad vet corps out there, it'd limit the amount of people they'd be able to screw over.|It probably wouldn't hurt to reach out and see what options they offer as far as that goes. I don't have much knowledge on that. But I understand everyone's experience with most corporate businesses is mostly clinic based, and not all clinics under a corporation are bad/negative. I have enjoyed most* of the people I've met through petvet, but I've enjoyed being out of PetVet so much more. There are better corps out there that genuinely take steps to put their employees first, but there's always pros and cons anywhere you go, and everyone's thresholds are different."

M1DA5_8294,"For context, I live in Scotland and wish to become enrolled in Glasgow Veterinary school. 

Qualifications: 

* N5 in maths, English, art, geography, modern studies, history and biology (All A's)
* Higher in Art, History, Geography, Maths, English, Chemistry and Biology (All A's)
* Advanced higher Maths (A) 
* 2.5 years of volunteering experience, and work experience at the local vets

However, the qualification requirements say I need Advanced higher Biology and Chemistry. Is there any possibility I will be able to apply without completing these, and are there any other ways of meeting the requirements as completing these would mean staying on an extra year in high school because of my poor subject choices earlier in my life."
Howtobe_normal,"The VMCAS applications process just opened for 2024-2025 and I have a question. I got a question asking me ""Have you ever been disciplined for academic performance (e.g. academic probation, dismissal, suspension, disqualification, ect.)  by any college or school?
Yes or No

In 2016, I was in a prevet program, and didn't meet the B+/C- requirement for the program for a class twice. Since I took the class twice, I wasn't able to continue the prevet program. I've since became an LVT, and got my bachelo degree. 

Should select the answer Yes or No? I just want to make sure I'm honest, but don't make it look like I'm trying to hide something, or give too much away."
Boleana,"I‚Äôm not a vet , I just had this sub randomly pop up in my feed and I find it interesting so here I am.   I recently adopted a 7 year old Frenchie and we‚Äôve been at the vet a lot with him figuring out different things with him.  I really appreciate how much time our vet spends with us and explaining things, we never feel rushed or pressured into anything. Yeah, stuff is expensive but I fully trust he‚Äôs looking out for our little guy and doing what‚Äôs in his best interest. I just had to say I‚Äôm sure the clients you spend extra time with really appreciate it.  Thanks for doing what you do."
PureBreadTed,">I‚Äôm also worried about coming across as unprofessional if I show emotion during a pet euthanasia.

I can't speak to how you'll come across in vet school. I've also only been in this industry for a few months.

that being said, in this time (I work at an urgent care) I've seen two vets cry due to completely heart wrenching cases.

first case was with a new-to-us vet. this case was not euthanasia, but unfortunately ended similarly. the dog came in limping. we'd administered pain meds via IV (iirc) and the dog immediately went into arrest. we attempted CPR but were unsuccessful. when we broke the news to his owner, it was gut wrenching. we were all in tears because it was completely unexpected. Dr later says he believes the limping was due to a clot and we may have unfortunately pushed the clot out of position while giving meds leading to cardiopulmonary arrest.

second case was a euth. an older dog came in because she got cut on the farm. she was a ""farm dog"". at the point the finally came in, she'd been bleeding for over five hours and had stalled her owners T-shirt in an attempt to help her clot. our DR was immediately suspicious and asked about rat poison. owner called a family member who was able to check and she did unfortunately get into it. while we were waiting to hear back from ASPCA poison control so we could transfer her to ER, our DR was demonstrating how to use an ultrasound for a new tech. The DR realized there was a lot of free-floating liquid in her abdomen. Dr asked to do an X-ray because she was older and intact. She unfortunately had pyometra. However, the owner was willing to pay for the expensive surgery, so she is good, right? wrong. by happenstance, the X-ray also captured nodes on her lungs. the owner had no idea she had cancer. this case was heart wrenching because despite our best efforts and an owners willingness to do whatever it took to get her better, she wouldn't be able to do so. in the end, we were all feeling it because it felt like everything was against this sweet girl getting better.

my point here is it is normal to have emotions in this job. we can't always be stoic like it doesn't affect us. those emotions make us human and show we care about the animals we are looking after."
outtathisworld02,A veterinarian for poison control? That sounds very interesting & that option never crossed my mind! Do you mind expanding on your experiences with that? What was the work/life balance with that like?
prinkly,"Wow this is a really comprehensive link, thank you!"
emtrnmd,"This is how it is in the human medical world too! It‚Äôs probably because the seasoned techs / seasoned nurses have more clinical experience and a better understanding of certain concepts but if they‚Äôre blatantly disrespecting you I would say something. You saying something might end up with them just mocking you but healthcare seems to be like a ‚Äúprove that you aren‚Äôt a moron‚Äù type of field across the board. I wish people were open to leaning on one another despite titles. I‚Äôm a registered nurse and some of the residents I deal with are literally incompetent, one actually got into a fight with a seasoned nurse about an EKG and then continued to fight with the attending about even though he was wrong.

My guess is something happened along the line of ICVAID matching to test ID, which makes me feel like even the people that saw their results might not have the correct information even if their name and ID matched on the report.

I just read for the Nov 1-Dec 16 session there were only 6,500 candidates‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd bet they have a few people going through each report manually to match everything up.  I just don‚Äôt see how they can resolve this in a day or two‚Ä¶ or how candidates can even trust this is accurate.

amyamv13,"I was a tech for several years before vet school, now I‚Äôll graduate vet school in a year! But one of the cases that always stuck in my heart was this sweet little cat. Her mom was the nicest person, and her poor kitty had Cytauxzoon felis. My personal cat came to the clinic to be her blood donor. Her mom was so kind and grateful. I let her come by over the weekend while I took care of boarders to spend time with her baby. 

Sadly her sweet kitty didn‚Äôt make it. But she made sure to tell us how much she appreciated the care we gave her. A few days later she brought me a gift bag with a hand written card, and toys to thank my kitty for his donation to try and save her. She got my cat a box of her kitty‚Äôs favorite treats too, which are now my cat‚Äôs favorite to this day. I‚Äôll never forget her|That is awesome, we are getting so close!!|I didn‚Äôt quite have a 4.0, but our stats were really similar. And I also had solid experience, LOR‚Äôs, and essays (I thought).

They say it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs just so many strong applicants, which is partially true. But honestly I think part of it is just roulette or them checking their boxes to have an inclusive class. 
Because once I got in I have many classmates that have ZERO vet experience or much lower GPA‚Äôs. At first it made me a little upset, like how did it take me this long? But we are all doing well, are just as committed, and deserve the chance. Admissions is just weird and don‚Äôt let it get you down for too long. 
Also looking back, I feel like I got in when I was supposed to, even though the rejection felt like shit at the time. I love the experience I got during my gap time, I ended up getting my Masters in Public Health too. I got to spend irreplaceable time with my family, which I appreciate so much now since my mom passed away right before starting vet school. I think it all happened how it was supposed to.

It took me a few years to work my way up to VA (From kennels, to reception, to VA) but it also wasn't really a goal of mine, just a promotion that was offered to me when I started to grow bored of reception. Tech school on the otherhand is definitely worth it IMO. Wage difference might not be huge to start off, but being registered will open doors at other clinics that experience may not."
HoovesCarveCraters,"1. Attend and graduate veterinary school
2. Most will do an internship after veterinary school, I'm not sure if they are 100% required but they are recommended. Some will practice for a few years first.
3. Apply for a surgical residency - usually 3 years, yes you will have to publish a paper and present cases
4. Pass boards|There is no ""best""

The ones I have experience with:

1. Banfield - Highly location dependent. I had multiple classmates work there after we graduated and I think only one is still there. She was offered a medical director position straight out of school. They pull you in with salary and signing bonus but can leave you haning.
2. VCA - VERY CORPORATE. I interviewed here and was scared away because there are miles of red tape and you are answering to 40 different people who you have to meet with constantly. Also seem to be pretty stingy in terms of benefits.
3. Vetcor - Worked for a clinic for 2 years. Pretty hands off corporation let us do our thing and didn't bother us. Contract with Idexx was nice for labs. I had a great mentor but I don't think Vetcor has a program per se. Definitely underpay if you don't ask for a good salary up front.
4. NVA - Like Vetcor pretty hands off, no mentorship programs short of finding a clinic that you like. Benefits and pay seem better than Vetcor.|120k is a lot of money. I'd go with LSU.

Something else to think about with RVC - in the UK students don't have to go to college before going to professional school. Even if you are accepted straight out of college, your classmates will be 18-19 year olds."

Ultimately, if an owner isn't going to come into your consult room with an open mind and listen then you won't change their mind. I'm pretty sure studies have shown that owners who prefer alternative medicines (including herbal parasite treatments, raw homemade diets, no vaccines other than the primary course with no Lepto 4 cover) are inclined to be distrustful of whatever we say.

Katmaybeck,"I became a licensed vet tech in 2016 and I worked for Banfield for 2 years as one of my first jobs. Sure I gained a tremendous amount of experience but also became aware of the sketchy malpractice the vets were doing there. They had really weak anesthetic protocols and literally used TORB/MIDAZ premed for every surgery- spay, neuter, dentals, even tho butorphanol has the weakest analgesia and they were afraid of using hydromorphone thinking it was this scary drug when in fact it is an excellent choice for premed sedation and pain control. I witnessed so many pets waking up in pain bc the vets follow a cookie cutter formula and are afraid to practice quality medicine. 

They never educated the owners or showed them the teeth in the room so they were clueless on day of dental, no forewarning on what periodontal disease is. They waited until pet under and charted to try to call and often the client had no idea they needed to be available so they wouldn‚Äôt answer and we would have to wake up the pet. If the owner did happen to answer, the conversation was always a surprise for the client, they would be shocked at the extra cost and decline bc they don‚Äôt understand they needed ‚Äúadditional services‚Äù. If the vets did their job and educated and provided estimates prior there would be a lot more compliance and quality treatment, but not the case here. There was one doctor that hated dentals and extractions so much he would purposely avoid contacting the owner about the periodontal disease. He would call once and then immediately tell me to turn off when they didn‚Äôt answer, did not wait 5 min or try again. One time he waited until after I took my 1 hr lunch and came back to take his, even tho we were supposed to lunch together and do another dental after bc it was a longer one. Well he was trying to stall for time to avoid having to do extractions. I had to advocate for the pet and tell him the owner requested full mouth dental X-rays (even tho I had convinced her to do them at check in bc they were not included at the time for Banfield dentals). Well lo and behold the dog had like 9 tooth root abscesses and he is immediately pissed that he has to start pulling teeth. We of course don‚Äôt finish in time and have to wake up without doing them all. Another time I was cleaning/charting and told him both back molars were a little loose. He comes and checks them and think one is more loose than the other but I didn‚Äôt agree. Well he just decides to pick up the drill and start taking out this tooth without consent from owner, no dental block that I recall, and just did it in a forceful way out of anger. It was extremely alarming‚Ä¶

They do assembly line exams where they would just flip the lip of the canine tooth and that was it. Didn‚Äôt do a thorough check of back teeth or incisors which are often worse in small dogs. Even the medical director was in it for the money. She did the fastest ‚Äúexams‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen and did not chart dentals properly. One time a relief vet was there and was saying how she always counts the teeth and discovered the 311 was dead but the medical director does not normally chart that thoroughly and seemed surprised (but actually this relief vet was doing her job properly and how it should be). Another time the medical director refused to provide solutions for this Yorkie with a heart murmur and horrible teeth bc she was ‚Äúnot gonna risk putting it under‚Äù. But heart murmur is not an automatic disqualification from anesthesia. She could have referred to specialty dentist. I took it upon myself to leave her a voicemail with information if she wanted to see a cardiologist/specialist bc the pet was suffering and needed full mouth extractions. But the vets didn‚Äôt care about the pets pain and oral disease there. 

Before they installed the digital dental X-rays we had analog and had to use dip tanks so we would rarely take them. I remember cleaning pets teeth with severe gingival recession, very deep pockets and furcation exposure. And we would just clean them and wake up. These same pets got dentals here for years and then when we finally get X-rays discover 9 tooth abscess. So imagine how many pets were never getting proper extractions of diseased teeth and just getting them ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù. That does not get rid of the pain and infection so those pets all continued to suffer from Banfield their whole lives!! Sadly this is not just a Banfield problem, but a nationwide problem for practices that still do not offer digital dental X-rays OR who still think it‚Äôs ok to take dental X-rays ‚Äúas needed‚Äù when they think a tooth is bad. But in reality X-rays are the only way to diagnose pathology 100% so don‚Äôt go anywhere that doesn‚Äôt take full mouth X-rays for every dental!

I soon after found a veterinary dental practice and left Banfield. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there or bring their pet there. I felt the pets were neglected in the kennels for hours, received incomplete physical exams and substandard treatment in general. The whole culture of Banfield is about pushing the most amount of pets to be seen in a day, maximizing the wellness plan signups, and a greedy profit driven agenda. Literally they would post signs on the walls that said ‚Äú12 drop offs before 12‚Äù or something like that. Techs had to often pull blood and place catheters by themselves bc people would call out or quit all the time. It was just utter chaos at all times.

Obviously this was a single Banfield horror story but I know it‚Äôs not the only one. I also did a relief shift once at another Banfield and it was soooo disorganized and clutter everywhere. They also NEVER entered the lab results for anything in house I noticed- cytologies, skin scrapes, FeLV tests in the computer. I‚Äôm not sure how they were able to get by with this? Bc if the pet came for a recheck you wouldn‚Äôt know the previous results? Maybe they would just put in the notes, I‚Äôm not sure but lots of things in their woofware records were SUS. I know the Banfield agenda is the same everywhere but I‚Äôm sure some vets practice much higher quality than in the clinic where I worked so maybe there is hope for some of these places but I would not trust them.|Maybe it has to do with‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been in the field 11 years, RVT for 7. and I was just rejected to vet school this year.

I asked the clinic manager if I could be responsible for filling medications, which kind of moved me to the back and was a good way to transition from strictly answering phone calls. As I spent more time in the back filling meds I asked techs if they needed help with anything or if I could practice my restraint on their easy patients. I just kept going from there trying to gain new skills.

As for the clinical sides of things idk why but the chaos really vibes with my brain.

If not then no shame in picking something that‚Äôs better for your mental health|It depends on where they‚Äôre working. Like I have my own stethoscope but my clinic also have a couple lying around for free use so I don‚Äôt ever have to bring mine. But if I ever leave my watch at home, I‚Äôm second guessing every heart rate or respiratory rate I get.

I just have to ignore them. Yes it upsets me but at the end of the day it‚Äôs their animals, their choices, and their money. They have to make their decisions and all I can do is try to educate them. If the animal is in a bad enough position I‚Äôll just call animal control and let them know the situation. We can‚Äôt help everyone but we can help those that want it.

SnooSketches8499,"What are some essential qualities to being a vet would you say vs someone who volunteers their time with animals? And would you say you regret going into this field?|Please help! 
I didn't well at all during my last spring semester of undergrad, and I really don't want it to stop me from being accepted. I did well in all my pre-reqs back in sophmore and freshmen year. The schools that I am applying to look at the last 45 credits strongly. I was wondering if I should be taking a bunch of summer classses to boost my last 45 credits, even if they are not related to pre-reqs? Please give me some advice in how I can bump up my last 45 credits?

I wouldn‚Äôt use a practice that required an exam to get the fee quote.|The difference in fees is wild. My solo practice vet charged a low exam fee because she didn‚Äôt want an exam fee to be a barrier to clients pets who needed to be seen. All meds, labs were 100+ mark up, radiographs were $90 a view. 

She moved away and my new solo practice vet charges a an exam fee $20 more than previous vet but meds are sold at about $5 more than ordering from a well known public vendor. 

The new vet ends up costing less because the meds aren‚Äôt marked up so high. 

One practice in the high money area requires full blood panel and chest X-rays for all spay/neuters, regardless of the pets age. That‚Äôs a $250 fee before the pet is sedated for spay/neuter. I‚Äôve scrubbed in for so many cat neuters and it‚Äôs astonishing that some is going to spend $350 for a cat neuter.|That is 100% correct.

Ohimesama781,"I remember a colleague of mine sharing a story abt a dog patient she had that had open-type pyometra. Owners were given the treatment options available (surgery or conservative tx with antibiotics); she also highly recommended that surgery be done. Owners declined surgery, decided to do an antibiotic course instead. Medications were prescribed, clients were educated on how to give said medications and other things to note abt their pet's condition (and to bring in their pet immediately if the symptoms seem to be worsening even with the medications). They were also advised to come back for a follow-up after a week if the pet's condition seems to be improving with the prescribed medications.

A week after the first visit, the dog is brought in in a worse state than their previous visit, owners are frustrated because their dog is worse than before. Colleague asks if they've given the medications as prescribed. The owners' response? No, they haven't given the medication *at all*. üôÉ"
