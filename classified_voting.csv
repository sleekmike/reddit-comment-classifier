m30wi3,always so jealous of students at csu not only for how highly ranked their program is but also for how beautiful fort collins is it s just outside of denver and at least compared to the small town my vet school is in fort collins is a way better scene in terms of things to do outside of school i couldn t afford csu with oos tuition but would go there if i had the chance i have a couple of friends that go to csu and they have told me their fourth year has been a lot more manageable compared to my school i m a fourth year at tamu btw i ve heard they did get their terminal surgeries taken away in junior surgery lab though so i m not sure if that s something that matters to you,Other

Depressed_Dishwa5her,thank you to all the responses ya ll have been really helpful id like to add that my main passion zoo veterinary and that is my end goal i do hope to work full time at a zoo but my parents want me to have a private practice and be my own boss to earn more personally if i cant work with zoo and wildlife animals then id rather not have my own clinic even if the salary is better i have always had a connection with wildlife and my main goal has always been in wildlife conservation from my experience zoos are the best way to be directly involved in the health of wildlife although i have done a lot of research i am always willing to learn more this is my passion and life long goal and the more informed i am the better,Other
LiveLoveLevelUp,talk to real people as well but our field has its fair share of bullshit i m sure every field does i hope it gets better don t be afraid to stand up for yourself be kind but show that you are willing to stand your ground its a complex issue we work in a very competitive field and obviously hierarchy is a big part of it no matter how much we want to pretend that we re all equal you automatically place higher due to your degree and it bothers people who maybe feel they should be above you they don t like loosing their place so they will try to keep it with these tactics it shows their lack of confidence and their immaturity but its also a part of survival and nature so you re being tested i d recommend working on your interpersonal skills meditate any type of personal development that allows you to feel grounded and confident in yourself stick to the people that treat you with respect and make sure they know you appreciate them don t let the others get to you set your boundaries if they cross them and take it easy they re just insecure you got this talk to real people as well but our field has its fair share of bullshit i m sure every field does i hope it gets better,Other
roxysinsox,i had a beautiful big flat basket sitting around at home but you could totally buy one and i went in and bought a bunch of the kinda stuff i chuck into my handbag when i know i may not get much time to eat granola bars nut bars though i knew that was safe because they had a giant jar of peanut butter out while i was there and you could smell it through the whole clinic single serve seasonal fruit ie apples oranges pears whatever is in season and will keep i bought a bunch of those little fruit gummy mini packs you put into kid lunches single serve popcorn packs single serve chips single serve snacks that were gluten free i think they were like yoghurt topped rice crackers in different flavours anyway you get the gist a bunch of single serve snacks i used thick cardstock to make dividers because audhd i also found a metal tin of fun sized candy bars that fit perfectly at the end i wanted something with a lid so wandering noses couldn t get into it by accident and added things like lollipops and i found a really fun box of cool stickers online that said pawfect and finished it off with a pen holder that had 25 really nice to write with but not pricey because i bought them in bulk pens and two dozen hb pencils with erasers on the end of them in it i think all up it cost me something along the lines of 40 but i didn t have to buy the basket and pen holder and the tin as i already had them it was kinda just a refuelling station for them that was 7 years ago and they still have it and they keep it very well stocked i see it any time they post photos of their staff area it s lovely,Other

Various_Piccolo9925,i m genuinely curious assuming someone has an average gpa and average vet hours let s say 3 5 gpa since that seems to be the average and a normal amount of vet hours what are the odds they get into vet school if they apply year after year to a variety of schools i always hear about people giving up after about 2 3 cycles but if they kept trying would they statistically eventually get in thanks so much i worked 3 years as a manager at chick fil a throughout high school so i definitely have a lot of customer service experience and am excited to implement it at the clinic i should probably add that i have a lot of animal experience hours already with shadowing working on farms shelters etc so i understand how to handle animals but am open to learning new handling methods at the clinic i also wanted to add that this vet clinic s entire staff i just going to be the vet me and the other assistant it s only a weekend only small clinic so i m not just going to be shadowing and the only experienced employee is the vet she purposefully only took in pre vet students for the job because she wants to teach so i m not at all worried about not being accepted with open arms or being in the way she hired us to teach us i m going to be handling animals from the get go thanks for your advice a lot of it was super useful specialization is key ditto this i m a purdue pre vet undergrad and love the hospital lots of amazing people,Other

corduroyclementine,some cats are extremely non compliant with getting their nails cut i don t think struggling to keep that up depending on the personal circumstances of the owner and the personality of the cat makes them a crappy owner but yes that doesn t make declawing the answer yea but in this particular instance with them being dewclaws with no ligament attachment the cat isn t using them so scratching to wear them down isn t really possible a person could have arthritis or issues with their hands that make cutting nails difficult i m not pro cutting off nails at all i m just saying an owner struggling to trim their cats nails doesn t necessarily make them a bad owner some cats are extremely non compliant with getting their nails cut i don t think struggling to keep that up depending on the personal circumstances of the owner and the personality of the cat makes them a crappy owner but yes that doesn t make declawing the answer yea but in this particular instance with them being dewclaws with no ligament attachment the cat isn t using them so scratching to wear them down isn t really possible,Other

thatfluffybabyduck,the best way to know for sure is to be in it take up a job as an assistant at a clinic in your area you ll see everything you can have emotions and feelings in this field it s just a normal part of being a person however you have to be able to compartmentalize and not let those personal feelings get in the way of what is best for your patients you have to be able to reel it in every now and then and realize that not everything is about you it s okay to cry and get angry it happens just make sure you re expressing those feelings in an appropriate setting if you have to take 5 or 10 minutes to collect yourself that s okay don t let people give you shit for it it s better that you come back to work with a level head,Other

windslut,have both it all depends if you want to do clinical medicine my phd is in pharmacology so many job offers with academia research and drug companies the dvm will offer you many clinical positions having both will likely mean you are destined for high levels of academia i got both but ended up in wildlife and zoological medicine great career but not much money board certified in another specialty but considered surgery due to skill demonstrated in residency just want to say of all specialties surgery is a manual dexterity innate skill specialty having worked with hundreds of vets some have innate skill and some will never be excellent surgeons so this specialty is one where natural talent may play a role you are probably a little early in your career to make this determination but there are many specialties you will be exposed to in vet school find a store that sells the brand abeo near you you stand on a pressure mat and the computer recommends an orthotic insole for you or you can even have one custom made i am a woman over 200 lbs and walked over 20 000 steps daily the abeo shoes or inserts and compression stockings made my life livable you only need the compression stockings up to your knee and amazon sells them up to size 6x,Other

SprinkleOfWisdom,sure you can i ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week so you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo zoo vets are often huge generalists so they often might phone in for advice from specialists even human md specialists i saw that especially with primates possibilities are there it just may limit some of your location options the most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school building good relationships and trying different experiences in vet med you may evolve your interests too which is great i m a veterinarian in the us so while i don t know the details of veterinary school systems internationally i can say with confidence that i would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager observe what they do ask them what they like and dislike about their job what would they like for their career path ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age never put all your opinions into one person take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values have fun and stay curious about possibilities,Other

MSmith3813,you are correct just more morons who think they are a veterinarian because of the incorporation of vet medicine and the subsequent world view created by veterinary schools and the internet being a veterinarian has changed dramatically and i am not sure it is worth it now as it stands you have little control over your fianancial success most young vets have not been through a recession student debt is absurd and out of line with earning potential if you can own your own practice become creative in how your market learn how to manage employees and build a values based business the sky is the limit both professionally and financially if you can t or choose not to pursue ownership i would say it is definitely not worth being a long term associate you are correct just more morons who think they are a veterinarian,Other

glitchgorge,so many awesome suggestions already i got a hip tech bag from this company when i started as a vet assistant and i literally can t work without it they re similar to the ones on amazon but they come in a bunch of really cute patterns so you could get her something more unique to her have zero interest in going the rvt route so the only way i can make it work is by having an equal partner to share expenses with and also doing a fairly lucrative side hustle in my case i photograph dog sports make around 20 30k yr doing that on top of my meager vet assistant wage which is higher than minimum wage but still low i really lucked out and my clinic is fantastic and supportive and is very flexible with the time off i need last year i also made around 2000 in quarterly bonuses we receive if the clinic hits their profit goals it s not a lot but it helps so much i definitely could not be a full time assistant if i wasn t able to find such an amazing clinic to work for,Other
theendisnear_,i m a rossie about to head to purdue for clinics in 2 months and i just love to read this lmao i ve heard nothing but bad things about this school for clinics and glad to see it s always been the same hahaha can t wait purdue was my last choice and i guess i got the shit end of the stick it is what it is i just hope it can t get any worse than it already is in my mind that s exactly what i ve been telling myself i don t think it has changed much even though they ve built all new facilities they re really fucking understaffed and i ve been hearing from current rossies there that the techs are absolute cunts to the students i m sure it s just a shitty culture they have there that s existed long enough to just never change in the end i know i ll be a really fucking good vet no matter what anyone tells me and i couldn t care less what bitter unhappy people think of me oh i agree 100 i say that now to feel better about myself but when i ll end up in the situation itself i won t be able to keep my mouth shut i want there to be change to this field and i ll do my part when the time comes will it bring to meaningful change probably not but i don t want to be part of the problem like you said and at least try to do what i can to make it better that s honestly crazy to hear i definitely don t know the extent of bullshit going on there then i did vet prep in fall 21 and now i m about to head to clinics in 3 months you can dm me if you have any questions it would be easier that way,Other
Affectionate-Owl183,i m a tech at an emergency specialty hospital they aren t treating you right even if they were hesitant because you were a fairly new vet which is somewhat understandable there is no excuse for such harsh comments and judgement i ve been in my field for a long time and unfortunately some techs can be petty but the majority of the more experienced nurses i work with love being able to nurture fresh minds in the field maybe their feelings are more personality based than medical based maybe the culture there is toxic maybe they don t have time for baby doctors and that other doc is the only exception anyway i wouldn t let it destroy your confidence you re fresh out and you need a supportive environment that ll help you learn and i m sure there s a practice out there with nurses that would love to help you grow your skill set when you meet them don t discount their valuable experience doctors aren t the only ones who can teach and hopefully they ll treat you well and want to see you succeed don t let the bastards get you down exotics tech,Other

brosius0504,hi i am currently a student veterinarian and i am going into community medicine and wildlife conservation once you get into school it becomes completely up to you what you want to practice what it comes down to is your level of competency so if you want to work at a practice and see exotic pets you just have to work with the place that hires you zoo medicine is something that a lot of veterinarians do on the side and as you become more comfortable dealing with the animals the more opportunities that arise there are not really any specific certifications you need but it s very competitive so doing residencies and internships will be very useful you can get board certified but talking to a board certified veterinarian she only suggest if that is the main avenue you want to explore i m currently going through this process so let me know if you have any further questions,Other

SnooMuffins8541,the need for new veterinary schools is questionable i m from a rural area and people would drive hours for veterinary care veterinary professionals are in demand there are mutiple jobs for every new graduate we are in dire need of vets and have so few schools across the us personally i m glad they are opening more schools in the us so hopefully fewer students will be forced abroad to the islands it would be super helpful to the field if there was a section for support staff assistants technician and receptionists since those roles are notoriously underpaid there was even a google doc from a few years ago that a lot of people contributed data too that might be nice to include somehow x200b was telling me they may allow foreign veterinarians to practice in nh i can t find any information on it though the state has a severe shortage just to clarify aquaculture is production of fish for food not a term used for companion animals it s agriculture that op is talking about i m really curious as to what studies that indicated issues in veterinary medicine that have been ignored what issues specifically do you think we need to be addressing i see a lot of issues in vet med while working as a technician in small animal medicine although i can t say much experience in veterinary school so far has been negative i love vet school but i am worried about going back into clinics full time and getting burnt out again you were talking about pet fish and aquariums so i felt the need to clarify that s not at all what aquaculture is aquaculture is a rapidly growing agricultural industry nothing to do with aquascaping or pet owners,Other
XoticVet,please don t ever be scared to admit you don t know something or can t do something if you try to fake it it will come back to bite you in the ass it s always ok to ask for help don t ever feel bad for doing that remember the ear canal in dogs and cats is shaped like a capital l there is a vertical and horizontal canal the easiest way to visualize the tympanum is to lift up the pinna and gently but firmly pull it straight up towards the ceiling this will help straighten out the canal so you can see the tympanum definitely practice on sedated or anesthetized animals whenever possible after you see it a few times it will become routine for you to see it you got this we are here to support each other,Other

Morgimeister,this is fantastic absolutely try to get this published saw that one of your references is from dr chigerwe at davis which i find ironic not that you used him but surprised he published something on this topic as i saw him do absolutely nothing to prevent the abuse of veterinary students and his residents when i was there 2016 2019 maybe things have changed but when i worked for c barn i saw his residents working 100 hour weeks regularly sleeping at the barn when they could skipping meals and being reduced to tears on a regular basis when i rotated through c barn as a 4th year with him i was there 80 100h week he also mandated that vet students work outdoors without providing appropriate respiratory ppe during the california camp fires when the air quality in davis was the worst in the world let s just say i m very much not a fan i think things have changed going home at 6pm was absolutely unheard of when i was at davis and especially on c barn per the 4th year below it does seem things have improved i m happy you had a different experience,Veterinarian
catanddogtor,gpa is certainly important for some specialties but the other method to land an internship residency is networking but it depends on the specialty of course i ve always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a b average in my fourth year i did rotations at locations where i wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics during my rotating internship i did an externship at the clinic where i wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well and they took me on as a resident outside the match making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared knowing about the diseases and medications jumping in to help as much as possible etc and now i m a boarded specialist meanwhile one of my intern mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was well very awkward also i went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations when they occurred before the match and then asked them for lors i m not too sure about what grades people are looking for my resident mate and i both just networked our way into residency outside the match for dermatology a good number of the residency positions are outside the match so you have a couple different avenues for residency higher grades are generally helpful for the match networking is very helpful in or outside the match doing a derm internship can make a big difference because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way navdf is a good place to network too,Other
With_Her_Spoon,is there anything consumers can do to help apply pressure i wish these experiences were more well known to the general public and pet owners i m stumbled across this after seeing some strange dynamics at my dog s last visit at one of the mars owned chains and i wanted to research a bit i was interested in finding a new veterinary practice that s kind to their staff because selfishly that staff is who is taking care of my baby and after reading through this as a consumer i have a responsibility to spend money responsibly and avoid companies with unhealthy labor practices if i m not allowed here as a non vet feel free to delete but this seemed like the most solution oriented post and i wanted to get feedback on how consumers can be better and recommendations for what due diligence we should follow,Other

flowgator,honestly i rarely do an otoscoptic exam unless it s very chronic unilateral and or there is a head tilt if an ear is bad enough the patient won t tolerate it awake anyways as mentioned even in healthy cooperative patients it s difficult to visualize if sedated or under general anesthesia i ll do a thorough otoscope exam but even if the membrane was in theory ruptured it doesn t significantly change my plan almost every ear cleaner medication is technically ototoxic in the middle ear so as long as the owner is aware of the risks i m generally fine continuing medication appreciate the insights same thing happened to a buddy of mine last year passed his second try with a 525 you got this male new grad in hcol community in south florida work 3 12h shifts a week and a half day every other saturday 130k base 22 production full health insurance 15 days pto 3 days ce 1500 year reimbursement for dea fl license plit avma vin plumbs,Veterinarian

kansasmanansas,i would argue that newer vets might be really great for your practice because they will gain technical skills and work up cases thoroughly a lot faster than they might in a practice that refers a lot out i would argue that newer vets might be really great for your practice because they will gain technical skills and work up cases thoroughly a lot faster than they might in a practice that refers a lot out i m a leftie and initially i found the leftie instruments to be a lot more comfortable now however i do some shifts at a shelter and do upwards of 20 surgeries a day there s no way i can expect leftie instruments there and i ve gotten so used to standard instruments that it doesn t make a difference any more one thing i ve noticed is that as long as the scissors are sharp they work fine once they dull they are impossible to use as a leftie good luck to you,Other
Lopsided-Switch-8404,my partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship i m in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture especially when you first join the profession or work at the elite level working long hours because you are in a complex busy and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me what is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment so many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of it was hard for me and so it should be hard for you the point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor not training patient care or gaining experience this internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns e g an intern can t have more than x number of inpatients at one time hours limitations related to overnight shifts etc that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis for example after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner s inpatients my partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients this happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything this is a common occurrence senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation there s an in house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly there needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules,Other

cymbals922,i ve been an assistant for almost 7 years my pay starting out in 2017 was 13 hr the clinic i work at was smaller back when i started and now we re at 9 doctors and we re very busy over the years i ve been able to grow into a more management type position unfortunately with that i do less vet assistant work and more inventory ordering and admin work but i am now making 25 hr in my position if you re able to work your way up and take on responsibilities within your clinic you can potentially increase your pay but that will probably come with less vet assisting duties if you re taking on different responsibilities or just more work on top of everything you already do so you should be prepared to have less down time or work more hours also i lived with a roommate for a number of years and i am now married so i live in a dual income home we can still only afford to rent between both of our incomes i don t think we d be able to buy a house any time soon i m considering finding a different job or even a career change to make more because even 25 hr isn t cutting it,Other

throwawaybutter2023,this depends on your goals which you do not have to decide upon right away focus on getting into vet school first for starters most zoos have exotics as part of their program plenty of zoos have ferrets rabbits birds etc which fall under the exotics umbrella because they re also common in the pet trade so if you re a full time zoo vet you will be seeing exotics but becoming a zoo vet is extremely competitive and difficult and will require a lot of personal sacrifice there are also vets in private practice who see exotics some even build up a client base so that they can almost exclusively see exotics some of these vets will volunteer time and resources with small scale zoos who don t have a full time vet and that way they can get a small amount of zoo exposure ultimately zoo and exotics has a lot of crossover thank you for this i did two internships because i was on the speciality path and burnt out i was essentially forced to not do a residency because i knew that i wouldn t survive it with how abysmal my mental health was from my,Other
