queerofengland,contrary to employers belief at will does not actually mean you can be fired for any reason with no consequences it may be worth contacting a lawyer for your case and see if you have any grounds this and now she s an easy scapegoat because they fired her i wish i had better advice for you but i m sure you ve heard all of the basics like setting a routine going to bed earlier etc hang in there well that s a bit rude there are plenty of people who manage to have healthy routine and outside lives while going through med vet etc school why is it wrong to ask for advice to balance your mental health and livestyle under a heavy workload and why does it upset you so you think people shouldn t ask for advice to make things better for themselves they should just ignore their issues bottle it up expect it all goes away i can see that method has made you a healthy and positive person please choose to be quiet next time rather than make things worse for someone looking for help we don t need it you aren t helping,Other

figureprod,will there be any focus dedicated to hiding ip addresses from the general public at least until you are paying for a connection i am afraid that having them publicly visible and scrapable would make it possible for bigger services to ban all ips on mysterium this could in turn make hosting a node seem way less interesting for those who do it on their main and only internet connection how are you planning to make it easy for new users to utilize the network the in app faucet was a nice temporary solution but ideally something more sustainable should be put in place akash the cloud compute network is looking into selling renting out unique ip addresses per their roadmap would this be a good fit for a partnership and if so how could the two be coupled together what up and downsides are there in using mysterium vs any other vpn if we take a look at privacy pricing and distribution to name a few will there be any focus dedicated to hiding ip addresses from the general public at least until you are paying for a connection i am afraid that having them publicly visible and scrapable,Other

NotaBolognaSandwich,i would talk to the boss and if there is no improvement i would probably start looking this sounds like it has less to do with you being a new grad and more about toxic coworkers what part of the appointment is taking you the longest use your techs depending on the tech to dr ratio i don t think it is wrong to at least ask for 30 min appointments for a period of time you are a new grad and will go slower and i think that can help with mentorship i would never ever expect a new grad to do less than 30 min appointments sounds like some bullshit to me too many variables but i wouldn t expect it to be great not sure if you are on the owner side or the new grad but as an owner any new grad i bring on the expectation barring a few exceptions is they will not be doing well with production and will cost more money initially as new grads are generally slower on how many patients they can see a day as well as with surgical time,Other

Asleep_Leopard182,i can t help with the first bit as i m sure there are plenty of others more qualified than myself to provide better advice here however with the second half around surgeons my best advice here is to come from their position understanding and meet that in your advance and behaviour being surgeons they ve gone through likely a bachelors then a 4 year doctorate then a 1 year internship a 4 year residency and then spent x number of years in a specialisation when you have that much education under your belt sometimes things can seem obvious or are natural to you from practice and or also being held to certain standards that are not obvious or natural to others particularly vet nurses and hospital orderlies which where i am can exist from zero formal education through to bachelors in general surgery which even at the highest form of training is about 9 years of education specificity below that of the surgeon knowing basic things being able to predict what comes next being able to notice the small things and being consistent solid in your approach if they ask for tape ensuring the tape is the correct length,Other

Varishta,i would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic you may fall in love and discover your passion or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect so i would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place loving cats is a great start but that alone isn t a good reason to work for a vet make sure you re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are if you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians they are similar but different positions especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more but also means more schooling and more responsibility stress there are legitimate respected vet tech schools online but you ll still need to find a physical,Other

Dargon34,when you treat technicians as colleagues instead of inferiors and approach situations with humility people are more likely to give you the respect you think you are entitled to very true points but if a doctor asks to be referred to as dr so and so part of that respect being a two way street is that it needs to happen not ignored and refused that s disrespectful and whether you respect the person or not all involved should be respecting the title if your personal opinion is different that s ok but theirs might be as well in regards to how they are referred to as and that s to be respected and ok as well agree with everything your saying but if op asked to be referred to as doctor and a tech refuses that s an issue how in the hell are you people getting it s disrespectful to be asked to refer to your doctor as doctor yeah whether or not you respect the person you respect the title if a doctor wants to be referred to that way as long as it doesn t go against the clinic standard then that s what you do,Other

phofighter,hi australian new grad here i have relocated overseas but can tell you most of my classmates are making 70k 80k in small animal practice a few less fortunate folks are on 65 68k corporate small animal clinics are were all offering low 70s mixed practice new grads with after hours seem to be on 75 85k a mixed vet who is 2 years out is on 105k with no after hours a smallies vet friend is 3 years out on 92k hope that helps just letting you know the pay in australia is much worse than the us i m a new grad vet in australia most of my classmates are on 65 75k aud there was a thread recently about salary transparency seems like the us salary is more than double and obviously usd but the big difference is that americans have severe student debt whereas if you re australian hecs is a much more forgiving system i will say though the journey to vet school is uniquely challenging every vet school requires you to submit evidence of animal veterinary experience and you ll need extremely good grades from your last degree to be even considered feel free,Veterinarian

3DPvetguy,currently in vet school hard as hell but well worth it it is a very good market for graduating vets with gps making great salaries i think it s a very interesting opportunity i m pro owning for sure valuation is very difficult because you probably don t know how much the practice profits and the owner takes in yearly typically practice valuations go as a multiplier of the previous 12 months profit 4 6x is pretty standard any higher than that is difficult to justify without significant opportunity to grow or add services it s one of the reasons corporations have been able to buy so many practices they can afford to overpay 8 10x profit for example because they have deep pockets and they ll make back the money by cutting costs or decreasing salaries so it s tough to say in this situation without knowing typical profit i d say anywhere between 8 20 profit is typically where most practices sit but there are outliers on both sides so if you gross 5 6 m and profit 20 then the valuation isn t as crazy if you profit 8 then it s absolutely wild as for partners,Other

ClearWaves,anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar there simply isn t a veterinarian with as much experience as this md other specialty surgeries like ortho or dentistry are also performed by mds or dentists the animals in question are too valuable to not have the best person available to perform the procedure would a human doctor be called to perform a c section on a lion no the lion s anatomy is closer to a cat than a human so a veterinarian is more suited for the job as far as legality goes every state has different laws and different types of animals are governed by different laws as in domestic pets livestock poultry wildlife laboraty animals etc research facilities follow different rules than a small animal general practice as a zoo is likely accredited as a research institution that means having to follow certain rules but also makes allowances for treatments that don t apply to a privately owned dog or cat in short in this case an md is the best person for the job and the laws of each state s veterinary medical board have set rules for different areas of verterinary medicine this comment,Other
ERCalm,i don t do gp but i agree with the recommendation remove digits if they become a problem to the health of the pet it s not being recommended for cosmetic purposes or for the health of furniture can it lead to other problems down the road possibly but inclined to think less likely since they re nwb digits and it s not all of them people on social media like to think what s shared is the entirety of a convo the vet who replied was out of line imo i rarely chime into posts to reflect on the dvm bc we all know things owners say can be a miscommunication from what was originally said eta no different than a happy tail that keeps getting opened and infected because owners can t won t follow home care instructions or if a wound on a distal limb is bandaged for care and owners can t follow bandage care regimen amputations are then discussed is it less than ideal that an owner can t be compliant yes but that long term only causes recurrent wounds to the pet in which case we work with what we have healing from amputation,Other

Ok-Cauliflower-4558,look up new vet schools on google you ll see them this is such an amazing thing to hear it s nice to see people showing support from outside of this field to answer your question and i mean this in the kindest most respectful way i think you should ask your husband what does he need after a long hard day maybe he s the kind of person that wants to come home and start a movie with his wife on the couch or maybe he wants to order take out because he s starving and have dinner with you at the table i think it depends on the person honestly i wish you both the best how do people get scholarships do you just have to have a phenomenal application not sure about zoo animals but i work in a clinic as va who also is also pre vet a veterinarian i work with treats exotics pets and pet birds but is also the vet for the local wildlife centers and nonprofits including kangaroos an anteaters lemurs hawks eagles a gator etc it s definitely possible to treat wildlife while also working in a gp that takes exotics just a matter of location and finding the right practice for you this is not entirely related to this thread but can you become a professor with only a dvm degree or is the phd needed i m interested in pursuing academia and research as well i really like ecology but i don t want to get a dual degree at least not more than an ms your gpa is extremely competitive i m also a junior bio student but most advice i hear is to diversify your application as much as possible which is what you re doing with large animal if you have the time it could be beneficial to try and get into some research with a professor that would definitely help you stand out honestly if i were you i woukd focus on keeping that gpa up because even if you don t get in this cycle you can get some experience next year and reapply and i m sure you ll have a great chance with that gpa you won t have an issues with cut offs or not being given file reviews because of it make sure you spend some time on your personal statement and be confident in yourself it will all work out in the end,Other

timetravelingwalrus,surprised at the number of people that disagree with this veterinary school is the ultimate dichotomy i would stretch to say every good and bad thing that has been said in this reddit community is absolutely true to some capacity and the experience is obviously highly unique for every individual extreme highs and extreme lows the entire time differing perspectives in vet med are valuable even ones like this this is the reality of the turbulent times in veterinary school and a valid experience that many face when they are pursuing medicine that isn t small large animal while i think this individual should continue school and they will find pretty amazing job opportunities aquaculture is in demand and crazy important these perspectives are valid and there is truth here ultimately no one can for sure say that veterinary medicine is entirely x or y obviously and if this deters people from pursuing medicine then maybe that s okay it s up to the individual to collect all info and decide what they believe is best for them veterinary school is wonderful and awful in every way this gives me hope as a soon to be new grad considering going into shelter for my love of community but also the work life appeal thank you for sharing your experience very veterinarian fills an important role in their community regardless of where it or with what company,Other

ohfuckmeee,i d say the answer to this question is completely dependent on what you would have to pay for said minority shares and the ebita margin of the business think of it like any other investment if you have to pay top dollar for the shares or the ebita margin of the business sucks then you might be better off putting the money in a different investment and just working there if you re getting the shares at a discount rate the ebita margin is healthy and you feel comfortable in the stability of the business then probably a good idea if you don t need the money right now an additional factor is i d also try to estimate how much this will obligate you to engage in managing the business and then if you re not going to get additional compensation for that do a mental cost benefit analysis of the time you ll invest in the managing compared to the dividend revenue and expected cap gains of the equity if that math doesn t add up then i d probably not go forward either,Other

Dragonsbane628,ohio vet here unless i missed something that s not even statewide policy last i heard it was by county whether it is required for cats dogs and ferrets to have rabies vaccines my county does require it so no big deal to me but as of 6 months ago it wasn t codified across the entire state yeah idk why we can t just simply pass a blanket law for the entire state but that s not my business i ll just keep my client s animals fully vaccinated and healthy,Veterinarian

Budget-Clerk-7282,like another poster said loop mee with a few veterinarians preferably several different ones every veterinarian and practice is different you can also check out vets for different species like horses exotics birds companion veearts etc this exploration of the actual daily job beforehand is important a lot of students quit because it is way different than expected it s not just cuddling puppies it s a lot of working with humans too and sad and frustrating moments it s also amazing if you enjoy biology medicine learning how the body works etc it s also very afwisselend not a 9 5 sit on a desk chair kind of job there are a lot of job options so you could explore further what you like when studying many vets switch at least once between jobs like food industry research or between different species the job is rewarding but tough the same goes for the studies go to the open days in utrecht and belgium remember getting in is hard as well have a plan b i think there is still an option to switch to the master veterinarian medicine if you finish the bachelor animal sciences in wageningen and choose a specific course you could go for ghent or antwerp too but those courses are quite tough on dutch students because of the cultural differences and differences in school systems if you re good at studying loads of info in ridiculous detail belgium could suit you though unfortunately they have an entrance exam now which is very hard to pass so prepare to study hard for that test if you go that road it s definitely not a requirement but if you manage to find some side job related to animals or even at a veterinarian practice you can get used to different animal species and also see what interests you i hope i don t sound too negative if this is the job for you it s gonna be amazing and you ll love it you will succeed if you put your mind to it good luck,Other

FrostyMeowmeow,i had a similar feeling when i first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after i graduated college and it took a year of soul searching to figure out what i wanted to do with my career as my degree was in general biology with a pre med track i decided medical school wasn t my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine but also the concept of zoology i shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics i finally got a job and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging i vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week what the hell did i get myself into the learning curve is steep but you ll learn to celebrate small victories it s okay to feel as if your client interactions don t go smoothly or if you could ve done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure my first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner during my last year of clinics i realized the world of medicine is much much much more profound than it appears i m finishing my last year of specialty training almost four years post doc the further you get along in your training the more science you incorporate into clinical practice i decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it s not gp gp practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume are expected to be jacks of all trades and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors i m fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies they do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist internal medicine is still very client heavy interaction however remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front facing interactions with the public you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team and depending on where you do your training students specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest but also part of the pre clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities these aren t things to worry about just yet you ll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling take it one day at a time it will be hard but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face knowing that you ve made a difference in somebody and their best friends lives,Other

Substantial-Humor-69,in general academic internships provide a more streamlined opportunity for research if thats your thing and generally have a higher match rate of interns into academic residencies without having to do a speciality internship first this depends on the specialty of course and again this is a generalizations there are exceptions private v academic can both be busy with long hours and high expectations however my experience in academia has been that there is a large network of support as there are many other trainees rotating interns specialty interns residents fellows and even students and because students are continuously rotating through the hospital and doctors hold faculty teaching roles they are more inclined to teach yes even interns for your school of interest make sure they have a high case load strong emergency department you will spend a lot of time here and enough faculty in your field of interest to mentor you and write letters some really good schools are losing a lot of their faculty and many residencies are on probation as a result good luck,Other
eggy_12,i applied this cycle and did not get in to vet school my cumulative gpa is a 3 2 and my last 45 is a 3 6 i had a rough first year of college i am torn between pursuing a masters and working full time as a vet assistant during my gap year thoughts if you re footing your own bill go to the cheapest school college is what you make of it and i don t think going to one school vs another will make a huge difference wherever you go do your best to get the best grades possible the benefit of going to undergrad where there is a vet school already means you can network within your own school maybe ask to volunteer in vet admissions or spend summers on campus at their vet hospitals as a vet assistant i don t think you can make a wrong decision here good job,Other

bostoncemetery,you can always work as a data analyst in the veterinary space too veterinary corporations are definitely looking for folks who have your skill set and also understand the mission of what we do and a lot of them will also pay for you to go to tech school as well yes i m actually a student in that program at purdue it s excellent i work in veterinary corporate my work doesn t pay for it but it s such a great program pet insurance wellness plan information is always good too set them up to be good clients for life is that weird i ve worked with many veterinarians who are hunters themselves i don t think that s strange there s a lot of crossover there you know that a lot of veterinary medicine actually revolves around food production right i ve been a rep for pet insurance justfoodfordogs and pet cremation services ultimately what you re being paid for as a sales rep is to be annoying it s actually called persistence but it sure reads as annoying sometimes incentives can be great but depending on the industry you ll be selling for could potentially be illegal it definitely was for insurance the biggest thing is to truly believe in the product you re selling if you do that and you genuinely believe that it ll improve life in the clinic for the team tell them that you re from clinic life you know what they need,Other
SupaGinga8,depending on where you are the amount of hands on tech work you re allowed to do can vary if you re in a state with title protection then you ll either have to start as an assistant or consider going to tech school if there isn t title protection in your state then i say find a place that s willing to train you on the job as a tech people get really uptight about title protection and uncertified techs performing that role while i agree that you shouldn t be doing things you re not trained in or are uncomfortable performing i do think that with the right training and environment you can get your feet wet and see what the field is like free continuing education is your friend find an area that interests you and seek out lectures conferences journals even textbooks in that subject i went close to 6 years as a vet assistant before moving to a state that allowed for licensure through my accrued hours of work and just recently got my rvt license as far as the field in general there will be long days there will be emotionally charged situations with clients statistically every single one of your patients will die before you do assuming you don t work with some crazy long lifespan species but there is so much to learn and immerse yourself in and so much good to be done consider the r o a d to happiness in vet med as one of my mentors put it radiology ophthalmology anesthesiology and dermatology plenty of medicine without a lot of the stress and grueling work of things like emergency care critical care urgent care etc those vets techs are the real mvps don t get me wrong i m grateful for every one of them and admire their work ethic and dedication wholeheartedly i had several classmates over 50 in my vet school class whatever you do do not under any circumstance take out private loans always go through the government,Other

Bennyandpenny,i m not sure what the culture of your clinic is but expecting colleagues to refer to you as doctor outside of client facing interactions is strange and is likely exacerbating any issues you have when you treat technicians as colleagues instead of inferiors and approach situations with humility people are more likely to give you the respect you think you are entitled to i am a specialist veterinarian and i interact with referring vets techs vet students etc and i treat every single person the same no one calls me doctor except to or in front of clients i have never once had an issue with disrespect from colleagues if you reflect on this and you truly believe that you are truly being treated with disrespect despite a good attitude then perhaps it should be addressed with management i find that demanding that people behave a certain way rarely works the way you will hope though yikes bad advice op is in no position to put them in their place they are colleagues and op is not their boss i agree the title is hard earned and should be used as op wishes the fact that a person is,Veterinarian
starwish68,op has clearly stated that other doctors are called dr so and so why is it an ego thing to not want to be only doctor not referred to as such in every clinic i ve worked at you refer to someone as dr until told by them to switch to either first or last name i regularly work alongside relief doctors and i always call them dr lastname until corrected and i am a dvm who asks coworkers to call me by my first name i find it rather telling that so many on here are quick to assume op is arrogant rather than finding it insulting they are being put down by someone s refusal to acknowledge their position these were some things that helped me in my 4th year keep your home in order remember to clean and do laundry regularly so your time off isn t used to desperately clean a messy place plus a clean house makes you feel less stressed to come home to meal prepping was also immensely helpful in making sure i had enough to eat because there will be times you re scarfing something down at 1am while writing notes without,Veterinarian

Servisium,this isn t not trusting you this is bullying i would say it s normal for techs to watch a new grad a little closer because we know they re likely overwhelmed and stressed and may miss things like a piece of gauze in surgery make a rounding error or mix up a drug but no one should go about it in a way that makes you feel stupid or inadequate it s ultimately supposed to be a supportive environment where everyone is helping everyone,Other

Cute-Cherry-7257,i am a 4th year student at purdue and this is 100 true be prepared to be the scapegoat for everything including the things outside of your control the techs dont care if it was or not your fault they ll still find any reason to treat you poorly yes evals can include things not pertinent to your ability as a veterinarian and just be personal attacks ive heard of people failing rotations where their only negative feedbacks are the most obscure and irrelevant things that dont really matter in being a good vet disagree theres life outside of vet school and i myself have worked many years in vet clincis before vet school not prepared for the real world is such an argument that is used to have people tolerate abuse at no point is disrespect warranted and not even the real world had been as bad as clinical year has been to me youre allowed to acknowledge the abuse around you and still be ready for the real world it just makes you human to feel these things,Other
ShelbyGT2024,sounds like there is a lot of issues with management and the team you are working with i can t say when the right time is to change jobs but if there are other options and you re not happy here it s perfectly reasonable to consider just wanted to add another perspective based on one thing you mentioned at the practice i work at it s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters prior to euthanasia i ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt our csrs always get that part out of the way first so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else no one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet if you re losing clients regarding this issue specifically maybe it s the approach that s needs fine tuning not necessarily the protocol,Other

Responsible_Ferret61,i m a tech and have been for 19 years i did take 9 years off to be a sahm i work part time and i absolutely love it still finding the right practice is the key though unfortunately there are a lot of toxic workplaces so sometimes you ve got to try a few out before you find the right fit pay is a big factor in the vet industry but it is improving and hopefully you will be well compensated when you re finished not trying to dissuade you but a few things to consider you would very likely be taking a significant pay cut if you move from finance to vet med vet med is not a typical 9 5 and usually involves a few later nights a week and weekends as much as the job is animal based it s also very much a people job and you have to like working in a team and dealing with clients from all walks of life and financial backgrounds sometimes the work sucks and burnout is a very real concern and the risk of mental health issues associated with the field is an important thing to consider the,Other
PurpleSludgey737,i m a pm in the us we head hunt 3rd and 4th year students who have excellent references from their professors we then offer a contact to work for us for 5 10 years depends on your production once employed in exchange for paying for the 3rd and or 4th year of school along with a 10 20k relocation bonus of which students normally put 10 5k towards their school debt there is a huge need here and practices are willing to help you if you perform well in school interview well and pass the navle learning the ins and outs of production and evaluating what a potential practice offers in terms of support education and estimate padding without financially castrating your client base should be a high priority for all new veterinary students also never accept an offer from a practice that has negative production accrual or you will fall even deeper into debt and be chained to the practice forever a standard production percentage for new grads is 21 22 paid out either monthly or quarterly many new grads put this towards their debt their first few years practicing make sure your first practice is run appropriately,Other
Sad-Rhubarb1988,i am sorry you re going through this it does sound like a very toxic workplace i agree with what many above have said but one question i had is are you constantly voicing these comparisons you re making about yourself your outcomes and the other vets in the workplace this can contribute to why people are treating you rudely no one likes it when their colleagues are being thrown under the bus hindsight is always 20 20 and something you may have now caught is not necessarily something your colleague has missed if you are seeing these cases and sharing with everyone how you caught something they missed etc etc that behavior can be off putting to them if you re constantly telling people you have no complications but so and so sutured omentum outside of the abdomen then again this won t be received well complications will happen to everyone it doesn t matter how perfectly you did everything something may be obvious to you at a second recheck but during the initial evaluation it was not as obvious to whoever saw it first please remember that because it is never the intention of any of our colleagues to miss something misdiagnose something or contribute to surgical complications you should bring up the rude comments your staff has made with whoever their supervisor is if you have concerns about the other veterinarians in the practice then it is something you can discuss with the medical director i am not saying how they are treating you is ok because it s not when a practice hires a new grad there is an expectation of some sort of learning curve need for mentorship being slower than more proficient and experienced doctors etc all the staff should be used to this and should be on board,Other

Angepainted,depending on the university hospital location specialties it is a great place to advance your skills and work on your vts the biggest issue with them is that the senior veterinary students are rightly the focus so if you like to teach and help them learn skills it s a very fulfilling environment to work in the pay is not the best or highest but because you are most likely a state employee there the time off benefits holidays are pretty good it s all about how you view your work life balance when it comes to that ah sorry yes senior veterinary student are those students who are in their 4th year of veterinary school during their clinical rotations in the hospital they are working to graduate veterinary school and become doctors dvm vmd in universities you also get to work with those that have already graduated and come in to work as interns or residents to specialize in a particular field of study the learning environment is ever present in many levels,Other

F13RYhufflepuff,that is horrific as a newer tech myself licensed at the beginning of 2023 i have dealt with similar techs they don t even trust other techs any sign of lack of confidence weakness they strike it s part of why this field is so toxic and bad for mental health would it be possible for you to respectfully stand up for yourself for example when the tech mentioned you might be good at sx one day but for now you are not touching their animals saying something like i understand your concern but that comment was unnecessary i did not offer or even suggest i do the sx so i would appreciate if you would keep your opinion of my abilities to yourself and allow the senior veterinarians to be the ones to assist me with my improvement or when they made the no offense but you re not good with any sick animal responding despite you saying no offense that was offensive and i would appreciate it going foreword that you would reframe from such comments you are not the one reviewing my performance or guiding me to being a better vet so your negative comments are unwarranted and unnecessary honestly that might be more snippy than necessary but you get my point a lot of people are bitter in this field make sure that it doesn t dull your sparkle we need the good kind vets who will support future baby vets and techs there is something to be said for confidence and reasonable caution i also double check my work i found others mistakes and my own frequently and for certain things i have others check my work i was told i was slow but little to no errors were made after a lot of criticism and jabs to my confidence i tried to go faster i made more mistakes and didn t catch them until after the fact all reversible and avoidable if i would been allowed to double check myself or ask for assistance i find if you don t meet the cocky confidence making fun hating on owners hating being aggressive with difficult patrons life sucks mentality you are rejected bullied made to be miserable sorry for ranting,Other

purdue2023,recent purdue grad here a big thing i would say is to take the horror stories with a grain of salt the unfortunate fact is that many students complain about any minor inconvenience and over exaggerate how much they actually work there are absolutely some blocks that are more time intensive than others sa and la med surgery and ecc mainly but even on those blocks we always got at least 1 full day off per week but these are balanced out by blocks with more leisurely schedules like ancillary or shelter med there are three big tips i have that can dictate how your 4th year will go 1 be as efficient and proactive as you can during the day if you can do this you can usually still leave each day at a decent time even on harder blocks 2 be a helpful block mate and don t dodge hard cases your classmates will notice this and will help you in return 3 approach every situation with a positive growth mindset you have worked so hard to earn the privilege to work with real patients and you will truly be amazed by how much you will learn and grow in one short year while no one loves being on the late shift in the er these are some of the absolute best times for learning ps even if a certain block isn t your favorite remember that they are only 3 weeks and will fly by,Other
squeaky-beeper,i remember hating those classes especially in first year i can also say that they are the single most helpful class i took in vet school miscommunications and hurt feelings will escalate any situation if you re able to communicate well and handle upset clients it s going to save your ass from a report to the board i would also point out that crying doesn t mean the class is bad it means it s a deep and painful topic for some people and i d rather vet students work on that in school than be blindsided out of school i would try to look more into why you re angry about the class your response is just as valid as others who start crying i had to do the same thing and it was worth it in the end,Other

bischswish,thank you for the detailed response what are the hours i m assuming these are relief rates since it s daily 750 is low for 8 6 but better 8 5 i would recommend hiring on full time vet and technician at 130k and 60k respectively you will have trouble breaking even at those contract daily rates in a rural area i recommend enticing people for full time employment i would also make it a priority to get your clinic approved as a non profit 501c3 org so that a veterinarian can get public service loan forgiveness through employment with you i think technicians can do that as well the fact that you will be non profit may help you be more competitive and pslf will be very competitive any vet jobs that fulfill pslf are 100k i m just worried your underserved area is underserved for a reason vet care is expensive and rural folks often can t afford even a rabies vaccine it s common to be inexperienced and slow at first i was when i started even after my development into a good well rounded vet they still treated me like a baby vet so i peaced out you may need to find another place and start fresh that s not giving up it s just finding a place that deserves your skills these classes are for people who have zero communication skills and need to learn how to talk to people you think it s stupid that they tell you to give eye contact and say hello but some people need to learn that i think that s why more schools are doing the mmi format some people need to be filtered out because they may be book smart but will never instill trust in a client because they cannot communicate so once you re out you ll be fine like most people male 4 years out 50 h no production liability and ce 2500 dea not reimbursed small animal only 125 h doing relief on the side 1 2 days per week gross about 130k texas medium cost of living my main job has zero stress is incredibly easy commute is 15 minutes i never work weekends and it is counting towards pslf i also have young children i can always hang out with sometimes less money works important to note vca and banfield both owned by same megacorp mars many more openings in red states and majority of dvms are women i wonder why too many sour grapes when you haven t started practicing yet steering people away because you haven t gotten adequate exposure in aquatic medicine an incredibly niche specialty with barely anyone practicing it some professors are arrogant and some aren t some clients are stupid and some aren t you will deal with assholes in any profession cost benefit is very different now average salary has gone up at least 20 report back in another few years it would be stupid to give up now i frequently used metro for enteritis colitis not anymore i never really used prazosin for uo in cats because the evidence was never really there prescription diet change is always better for both recently plumbs changed their metro indications section and flags that specific use as controversial also links those studies you mentioned go plumbs i m not going back just thought it was funny they found the money magically the hospital i worked at consistently has the main doctor going on maternity for entire q1 2024 they were trying to play games with me and now they are fucked more than half of the days each week will be dark i do feel bad for the technicians because they are paying the price for mars being greedy i hope they bail too and realize their worth,Other

gym_and_boba,i m very sorry it sounds like you work for a toxic clinic you and the new tech aren t the problem you have clinic mean girls i m a tech and no matter how frustrated i may get with a dvm due to lack of time management or whatever the case i would never ever ever speak to them like that it s not only disrespectful to your colleague but just not how you talk to any human being who hasn t done anything wrong you sound like you are doing great and again you aren t the problem i hope you and the other tech can find a better clinic to work for definitely report the problem techs to management,Other
HopefulTangerine21,agreed this is a very toxic environment i d find a new place to work experienced techs are supposed to be there to help and support new doctors not tear them down over the course of my career as a tech i ve found that bad doctors are bad doctors regardless of how long they ve been practicing i ve worked with a lot of new grads who were better doctors than the 10 yr experienced vet being careful and thorough is expected from new grads and your techs are supposed to be there to help things run efficiently and be a sounding board if you need it so this sounds like a clinic culture issue and leaving is really the only way for you to have a good outcome i would be very forthcoming about the reason why you re leaving so the pm can hopefully get things fixed for the next new grad but trying to get those changes in place while you re working there typically backfires because the techs will blame you and things will just get worse been there lived that and left the practice for a better one,Other

sweetmissdixie,i m so sorry that s a super frustrating position to be in i m on the human side of medicine and have definitely been in your shoes with medical assistants and nurses before initially i didn t say anything because i was worried about coming off as rude i got walked all over until one of my colleagues who was much older and more experienced than me stood up for me when she overheard someone giving me attitude she then took me aside and told me not to ever let anyone treat me that way i did end up moving because like it seems in your situation it had just gotten bad enough and gone on long enough that there was no fixing it but moving forward at the first sign of attitude i say i m not sure what has led you to believe it s ok to speak that way to me but it isn t don t let it happen again regarding the so and so doesn t make me do that i just simply say well i m not so and so thanks for taking care of that for me and then i walk away discussion over it cuts it out pretty quick good luck op don t forget all your training and education have confidence in yourself your job is to take excellent care of patients not be friends with your coworkers they don t have to like you but they absolutely do have to treat you and other colleagues patients etc with respect and professionalism don t tolerate anything less,Other

FunConsideration3476,please don t feel like you re behind clinics will always be hiring and you re not missing out by not applying now if you know exactly when you want to start working after graduation just try to have some serious searching done 2 months prior i had colleagues who did not start until april or even close to graduation and i had colleagues who did not start looking until after graduation all of them found a job with plenty of time to spare as for interviewing during rotations everyone does this differently i used externships as interviews others did half day working interviews during rotations or used vacation time at this point your school people will be aware that you and your peers will be doing some serious job hunting and most rotations were fine with people taking a few hours off during some day as long as it was cleared in advance female va small animal gp 2023 grad base 115k with 21 production 15 days pto 3k ce with 3 ce days work 4 day 10hour shifts with 1 half day saturday month 401k with 4 match and generally great benefit packages non mars corporate i graduated may 2023 and ended up choosing an mvp clinic and i have been very happy with my choice they have been relatively hands off in terms of how we are allowed to practice medicine and if the clinic does well then the support staff gets a big chunk of the extra profit at the end of the year x200b i also received offers from banfield too corporate for me and an svp southern vet partners clinic and the svp offer had much more corporate red flags hidden in the small print and there was no focus on the support staff in their mandates my experience with the mentorship program they have has been overall positive but i do think this depends greatly on the doctors and management at the individual practices too we are basically assigned a mentor should have weekly meetings with them and our schedules should overlap closely with theirs the management at my clinic has been very focused on do not drown the new grad ease into things which is not the situation at every place x200b i do know one new grad at a different mvp clinic whose assigned mentor went on maternity leave 2 months after she started and she was left hanging a bit so really important to get to know all the doctors at the practice and make sure the ones who want to be a mentor are gonna be 1 around and 2 really willing,Other

quantizedd,same i m boarded la surgery and making less base than new grad small animal gp i do okay with production but i bust my ass for it 24 7 365 i m a left handed boarded surgeon it was hard at first in vet school to force myself to use right handed instruments but unless you re only doing a couple of simple surgeries per day you are unlikely to have packs of left handed instruments using right handed needle drivers in your left hand sucks because when you turn your wrist to pass the needle it will open the jaws i highly recommend sucking up and figuring it out it s much easier in the end it s unfortunately a right handed world honestly for a while i was just doing both but now i m way better right handed now i freak people out because i cut with both my right and left hands with the scalpel being left handed is an asset really,Veterinarian
JustNaNaNa,what do you want in a practice most new grads don t stay with their first practice for more than a year because they followed the money or some other reason some things i made clear i wanted as a new grad was mentorship above all else if that s important to you make sure you bring it up if they say they don t offer it thank them for their time and move on is work culture important to you some vet clinics historically have toxic work culture is the turnover rate for support staff high are they always hiring those are red flags for me search up the companies you are being hired with on indeed or glass door to see if there have been good experiences for employees if you have the option ask to follow them around for the day listen to how the support staff talk when the vets aren t around do you want a family close knit team or what have you work life balance important many new grads are focusing more on work life balance and a lot of companies are trying to get more vets by offering 4 day work weeks or 3 day work weeks do you hate surgery find a practice that allows you to never do surgery my friend hates surgery and has found a gp that allows them to just see gp urgents whatever region you re working in a quick google search can help find a rough average salary of a vet do some searches on reddit to see if anyone posted about the salary they make big city more than likely over 6 figure salary some rural area maybe mid to high 5 figure assuming us also depends if you re small animal only mixed or large if you have to move calculate what would be an adequate moving bonus how much would it cost you to uproot your stuff and move signing bonuses for new grades range from 0 50k i ve seen from my colleagues sit down and think what you want in a practice and what s more important to you if you re in north america it is basically an employee market and you have a lot of negotiating power because of the high burn out and companies desperately needing vets,Other

Ok_Sky4744,agreed it s clear that commenters are reading what they want to read in op s statements and not reading what they actually wrote which is that the staff member is refusing to use the title this is why online vet communities are getting so toxic and this is why nothing ever changes it s easy to post a hashtag but much harder to face that so much of the call comes from inside the house you worded it so perfectly i never specialized because i suffered mental abuse and bullying from clinicians and other students in school been saying the profession is long due for a massive reckoning agreed it s clear that commenters are reading what they want to read in op s statements and not reading what they actually wrote which is that the staff member is refusing to use the title this is why online vet communities are getting so toxic hoping that nomv group has changed for the better i left it a few years ago and the way a good number of vets acted in that group made me wonder if they would inadvertently contribute to the statistic that they provided lip service against i haven t had great experiences with vet med facebook groups including nomv but there was a really good vin run support group for new grad veterinarians that when i still used facebook i absolutely loved very kind and supportive environment with colleagues in your same shoes i so wish i could remember what it was called best of luck with your current job and take care of you decide to venture into those groups eta typo and i did remember it was specifically a facebook group run by the vin foundation if that helps idk how to edit this but thank you all for your contributions i mean this is a thread full of everyone shouting their experiences over each other but i overall agree with the statement that veterinary school education and the entire industry needs a massive overhaul if we want people to stick around your experiences are valid op i had some awful ones too eta but what i will say is try to take as much time for yourself as you need after graduating and find a job that will allow you to ease in i said many of the same things 4 years ago and it did get better they ll downvote you bc ultimately you re right so many believe two things can t be true at the same time but they can you can love this profession and have fulfilling career in it and point out its glaring flaws,Other

thezuse,i don t understand the criticism you are receiving i think there s even a way to do a dual mph i seem to remember you seem like you took a very analytic approach to the degree and didn t get caught up in the identity part of it is this advisor a dvm or equivalent i doubt he is getting much direct feedback from people 10 years out regardless also the name of the game with this degree is people change their minds all the time there is a high barrier to entry into this field training actually passing the navle so pickings can be a bit more slim during an economic downturn but it s not like you will ever be competing against thousands of applicants well except in zoo med there isn t really a fix for this put in a year or two and build up your confidence and experience and then move on and then the next hospital will only know you as an experienced doctor i was treated much different at my second job than my first job by the support staff it was probably also a better environment the support staff at the first hospital also picked up shifts at the local overnight er and the techs relief doctors there had a toxic relationship anyways from they way they talked about it i general don t go to reddit for this sort of stuff i don t know your country but there is a lot of variation in the field worldwide and people won t know what is expected in your area there are closed groups on facebook where we chat your classmates can refer you in some are more specific moms etc some are about cases nomv is okay but you can probably find one more for new grads good luck,Other

HatExpensive2537,this is a fine workaround until it can get fixed we don t know what end is leaking if the female end is leaking and they don t need this drop they could disconnect the drop entirely but this is fine you see all kinds of crazy things the are cobbled together in vet med how would that happen the flowmeter takes it from 50psi or whatever the central system is set at down to 0 4l min the only thing this will do if it came undone is to blow out oxygen from the quick connect fitting thus wasting oxygen unless the anesthesia machine itself had a leak in the high pressure system and the pop off was closed and no one did a pressure test and no one was watching the patient this would not cause barotrauma it needs to be fixed but it s not dangerous to the patient,Other
PrettyButEmpty,if you are in the us acvs requires a rotating internship or equivalent i think 5 years clinical experience in private practice realistically this means that almost everyone who wants a surgical residency does an internship twofold meeting the requirement and possibly even more importantly making contacts with surgeons applying for residency requires you to submit letters of rec from acvs diplomats if you are out in practice for 5 years and the only surgeons you know are your professors from school it will be challenging to get the number and quality of letters that you need to successfully match given the competitive nature of surgical residencies it is also common for applicants to complete 1 or more surgical internships so i would also keep that in mind during your calculations if you work in a position that allows you to maintain regular contact and good relationships with surgeons an alternative path could be an option but it s an uphill battle unfortunately i have also heard it expressed by multiple surgeons that they prefer new doctors as residents as they are less likely to have bad habits so i would also be leery of that bias harming you in,Other

ntnt123,vet med is a great profession as long as your finances are straight your mental health is solid you can compartmentalize well and you develop a healthy relationship with your identity as a veterinarian mine subsided 4 years post grad it took me 3 tries to get into veterinary school best thing that happened to me actually i was the ripe age of 26 when i finally got accepted and graduated at 30 im 10 years out now i got a dual masters degree travelled the world worked at the cdc made lots of connections matured saved money and in general lived life it was a hard transition to have my freedom and life put on hold for the 4 years of schooling i would not change a single thing about my journey it made me a well rounded person and professional it all happens the way it s suppose to trust the process yea for sure headed by finance bros best terminology to describe them speed comes with time and experience right now just focus on getting comfortable with this new version of you because being a veterinarian indeed is a different you and practicing sound medicine speed doesn t mean anything im 10 years out some rooms are fast some rooms are slow i started relief in 2019 i graduated in 2014 i would not recommend relief until after at least 3 years of experience best of luck im 10 years out and never even considered specializing doing an internship residency but after what i went through and witnessed during 4th clinicals shit that was just scraping the surface of a dark underbelly of this profession after reading your article and the comments there needs to be an undercover documentary produced about this this fuckery is on the same level as child labor human trafficking wildlife trafficking and all the other dark shit that gets swept under the rug it needs to be brought out to light vet med is a great profession as long as your finances are straight your mental health is solid you can compartmentalize well and you develop a healthy relationship with your identity as a veterinarian,Veterinarian

inigomontoyajoke,went to purdue some clinicians are good some are nasty and same for techs i bet i know which clinician complained about posture my first rotation they told me i talked too much and wasn t serious about vet med elective rotation second rotation they told me i talked too little and was too serious but ultimately i did get a great education there edit not to say that this is the only way to get a good vet education it s not also this does not excuse or negate the bad parts would have been a lot better if clinics didn t make me nauseous some rotations i wish i could say it s different in other vet schools but doesn t seem to be the case have a friend who went to colorado with similar stories honestly most of the senior clinicians were reasonable and helpful some of the residents were not great it was well known that some people would fail a rotation because of a resident repeat the rotation different resident they would get as the inconsistency and the judgement based on if someone liked you was frustrating i had one block where the resident hated,Other

bestvetgirl,maybe it s a good thing meaning they are getting ready to restart the process of score reporting so accurate where did you see that exactly and why not receive the results immediately after the test i just don t get how come we have to wait for it so long i think they should just inform us that the results would be in 2 weeks l and everyone gets 50 bonus points for the inconvenience,Other

mirmarti437,i think in our field you really do have to fight for your salary it sucks that we as support staff get paid so little but if you are at a decent company you can fight for raises i ve been an assistant for 3 years and have had to challenge every raise i ve gotten and have always gotten more take advantage of the shortage right now and know how much you re worth as an experienced assistant if they don t offer you a raise it may be worth looking elsewhere,Other
rotten-cheese-ball,i ve taken a nationally administered exam before they literally made me pat myself down before going into the exam room and put all my stuff in a locker except for my government issued id bestie they re not going to let you look up answers if you re in nyc i think it s harder since i m pretty sure you need to be certified in order to be a vet tech though i might be wrong if you go to school in a state that doesn t require you to be a certified vet tech i d say you might want to consider taking a part time job during the semester if you can pack all your classes into 4 days that gives you a full day to work and maybe pick up a shorter shift on the weekend it can be a lot but honestly i ve been doing that every semester where i work on fridays and i love the change of pace and it s a nice end to my week but if you do this try to find a place that s accepting accommodating of students if you can i ve never had a problem taking time off to study for midterms or finals since my boss really values school and tells me to put it first but i ve had friends tell me how they had a lot of trouble getting pto to take an exam that falls on a day they are scheduled for even when they requested that day off long ago and their schedules come out weekly,Other

Puzzleheaded-Fly9461,uf was just as bad i was floored at how unprofessional the professional school was from sexual comments during surgery to racist observations about clients and even occasional laying of hands on students uf was toxic af add onto that the fact that most faculty don t know how to use the learning equipment and refuse to learn it was a terrible experience all around i remember during a surgery with him and a third year resident where he proudly announced to the entire surgery suite how much better said resident had gotten at screwing and then gave us all a hearty guffaw as if he cracked the funniest joke we all looked down quietly and all i could think was what is this middle school i also heard the stories about him laying hands on students and was genuinely nervous going into that rotation that he would try that shot on me wouldn t have ended well we had a resident in derm ask if a certain client was mexican because they always own breed x can t remember the breed they said it in front of a latinx student and she called her out on it saying how,Other

ShopKey2536,do you mind if i dm with some questions as well looking for a work life balance like this about how much are you producing in that area i m really not trying to be rude but a few hours maybe my experience has been very different i understand some people may have to study much more than others but i think it s irresponsible to normalize only a few hours of time off a week i would say give yourself off at least one full day off the week if not two to do absolutely nothing school related obviously some weeks will have more stuff to do than others but school cannot be the only thing in your life if you want to be happy,Other
owlex,it probably won t be especially in a hcol location based on what you ve described may be worth considering a different approach hire some relief veterinarians and see if any of them mesh well on a mutual basis i know a fair number that dip their toes in a hospital end up falling in love with the hospital and then elect to make that hospital a dedicated commitment or even accept employment through them i ll echo what others have said here it s kinda a bit that way no matter where you go with regards to interpersonal politics and drama playing an oversized role in how 4th year goes for you i felt like there was an added quality of life boost if you re a guy the bar or expected requirements seemed lower some of it is probably how you approach it you stated you felt like you needing your ideas heard or having a negative response to the expectation of being supposed to go along with it i basically just framed the year as i m gonna be free labor and to just roll with it be friendly helpful and observe i knew i was last on the hierarchy of teaching staff residents interns and technicians i never had the sentiment that my ideas had to be heard or was expected to do anything other than go along with it i was just there to learn roll with it and get out the other side and i say that as someone with a huge anti authoritarian streak,Other
FairEmphasis,this is my biggest sticking point for corporate medicine my boss wants to have a video chat once weekly that i just say i m too busy for half the time and i barely have to interact meanwhile the privately owned practice i worked in previously had the owner entering the exam room to question doctors in front of clients all the time and then would want to be joking around afterward are ya kidding the non veterinarian behind a desk in a different state setting my expected patients surgeries per day is annoying but the day to day is so much better it s maybe more soulless but until i feel like opening my own it s either corporate or relief for me i guess a question i d ask is why can t you afford a 120k salary on the east coast in a hcol area a doctor working 40hr in a hcol should be making plenty to warrant their salary unless you don t have enough appointments to facilitate that in which case you re not ready for another doctor anyway if i d have to put money down i d have to bet that it was,Other

plz_res_me,yeah i might try reading the owner and seeing if theyll upkeep or not regardless of the most correct choice another vet chiming in from purely based on a cat owner s perspective with no context is very dumb lol assuming no context they also never stop talking like smh i got appointments why do you need to know what anesthetics i m going to use how they work and what route they re going in ur cat i can tell you anything and it wouldnt make a difference to you the what are you using and route for curiosity is fair tbh my bad i also never care when ppl ask that but the how they work in combination with it all im sure they know how they work already so at that point i feel like i m being quizzed its just all in the context with the owner where it feels that way not always i shouldve said sometimes i wonder if its in my head that they judge but i also never rly get that judged feeling from anyone else ex wildlife here we know a little about a lot of things basically lol i had,Other

captSNAX,for what it s worth i ve had 13 years of experience with banfield from the other side of the counter and their care and service has had a noticeable decline over the last few years enough so that we only took our dog there for routine bloodwork and vaccines because they were included in a care plan that couldn t be canceled the last surgery experience was a total nightmare that started with them not having the sedative to put her under on the date of surgery and ended with a tech bringing my 13 yo dog out while still pouring blood from the incision sites and sutures already coming untied this required no less than 6 follow ups for post op care my wife was a vet tech for years and i am in biology research so we kind of knew what red flags to look for we notice a lot that were similar to what you are describing that being said i understand your position i m not sure how your field looks at previous practice reputation but if that is a factor then i wouldn t want my name attached to that company sterility issues are a big deal and an indicator of attention to detail personally i would hold out for vca have had some positive experiences with them or look for alternatives maybe a smaller practice in your area but i understand the need to acquire experience so if you do go with banfield i would keep expectations low and keep an eye out for better opportunities best of luck,Other
